(0) When stamps have risen in value to a certain degree , even if you ask [3m[32m{someone}[0m to , [3m[32m{he}[0m wo n't use [3m[34m{stamps that are worth more than their face value}[0m as postage . 
(1) The more stamps appreciate , the fewer stamps will surely be used as postage . 
(2) This reasoning is obvious . 
(3) Second is using the scientific approach to development to decide the quantities of stamps distributed . 
(4) When the quantity of stamps distributed is large or too great , the practice of stamp collecting is damaged . 
(5) The number of stamp collectors is then greatly reduced . 
(6) This has been proved by past events . 
(7) The quantities distributed of new stamps must be appropriate for the actual situation . 
(8) Too many is no good ; too few is no good either . 
(9) This is the fourth way to get rid of [3m[33m{them}[0m . 
(10) The destiny of [3m[33m{discount stamps}[0m is : [3m[33m{they}[0m came gradually , [3m[33m{they}[0m 'll go gradually , and despite everything we 'll redouble our speed .
