(5) Low - Cost Flying ; [3m[31m{the Chunqiu Airline Experience}[0m . 
(6) [3m[35m{vox}[0m 
(7) [4m[36m{The country 's}[0m first civilian - operated airline is headquartered in [4m[33m{Shanghai}[0m . 
(8) The first impression is that the English name is too vulgar , china-sss.com , would anybody be interested in putting [35m{this company 's}[0m announcement on Jay Leno ? 
(9) [3m[35m{I}[0m heard people saying [36m{the ticket prices}[0m are cheap . 
(10) Then [3m[35m{I}[0m went online and looked ; there are A and B classes , but no first - class cabin . 
(11) Every day a certain number of specially priced seats can be reserved only online . 
(12) [36m{The ticket prices}[0m are certainly the cheapest . 
(13) [35m{Chunqiu}[0m is encouraging online booking with a 30 - yuan discount , which saves on costs . 
(14) But paying online in [4m[36m{China}[0m is extremely complicated ; that 's another story . 
(15) [31m{The baggage limit}[0m is 15 kg , but [3m[35m{I}[0m see lots of people whose baggage are definitely over [31m{that}[0m . 
(16) [3m[35m{I}[0m did n't see complete data online for [35m{their}[0m flight safety record . 
(17) [3m[36m{The A320 model}[0m is one commonly used only on minor routes . 
(18) The planes are not as old as the same models in the U. S. 
(19) Signs say the life vests are under [3m[34m{the seats}[0m , but in fact under [3m[34m{the seats}[0m it 's absolutely empty . 
(20) Someone next to [3m[35m{me}[0m asked [34m{the flight attendant}[0m , and [34m{she}[0m was unable to answer . 
(21) A male flight attendant then said there were no life vests . 
(22) After [3m[35m{I}[0m got back to the States [3m[35m{I}[0m hitched a ride on [33m{a plane of the same model}[0m , and the signs said the seat padding could be [4m[32m{used}[0m as a flotation device . 
(23) [4m[32m{That}[0m must be correct . 
(24) On board , aside from a small bottle of water , no beverages were offered , but [35m{they}[0m were selling [4m[31m{boxed meals}[0m , [4m[31m{all of them}[0m with the same packaging , for ï¿¥28 a box . 
(25) There were also soy - sauce eggs , preserved eggs , peanuts and other snacks . 
(26) [3m[35m{I}[0m do not feel that this is a good approach on brief short - haul passenger flights . 
(27) First , [35m{they}[0m have to remember the passenger 's order and seat number , collect the money -LRB- and check for counterfeits -RRB- . Then heat [3m[32m{the meal}[0m , deliver [3m[32m{the meal}[0m ... there 's more than just one type of meal , and the preparation is n't always simple . 
(28) It 's all helter - skelter enough . 
(29) Many people were still eating just before [33m{the plane}[0m landed . 
(30) Plus [35m{they}[0m also enthusiastically peddle gifts to earn extra income . Such as model airplanes , dolls ... 
(31) [3m[35m{I}[0m saw one person pay 200 for a model airplane . 
(32) In order to reduce the number of empty seats , [33m{the plane}[0m even has [4m[35m{passengers going to different destinations}[0m ; after [33m{the plane}[0m landed at [4m[33m{Shanghai}[0m , [4m[35m{those people}[0m stayed on [33m{the plane}[0m and waited for the cabin to be cleaned and tidied , and only after new passengers were boarded did [4m[35m{they}[0m continue on [4m[35m{their}[0m way . 
(33) After [3m[33m{we}[0m landed at [4m[33m{Shanghai}[0m , an airport bus [4m[34m{transferred}[0m [3m[33m{us}[0m ; [35m{they}[0m did n't use the bridge . 
(34) [35m{They}[0m said [4m[34m{this}[0m was another cost - saving measure . 
(35) In short , [33m{the plane}[0m was on time , the baggage was delivered quickly , and the service was OK . 
(36) This kind of train - like business approach is rather unusual .
