(0) Recall the story of mandatory newspaper recycling in [4m[36m{the District}[0m . 
(1) As a political city , [4m[36m{they}[0m created so much waste product [4m[36m{they}[0m flooded the market . 
(2) If you want to look down the road , think about what is going to happen after we spend a few billion to meet the [33m{Chesapeake Bay}[0m waste water restrictions . 
(3) Where are we going to put [36m{all the sludge that results}[0m ? 
(4) Once we stop putting [36m{it}[0m in [33m{the Bay}[0m , we are going to have to put [36m{it}[0m on the land . 
(5) Then we will have regulations to prevent sludge runoff in order that we do n't pay for the same sludge creation multiple times . 
(6) Eventually we will outlaw gravity so that sludge is prohibited from running downhill . 
(7) Coming soon to a farm near you : two month 's worth of stench . 
(8) As an engineer and a flinty New Englander , and a farmer , [32m{I}[0m spend a lot of time fixing [4m[35m{old junk}[0m . 
(9) [32m{I}[0m ca n't stand throwing something away . 
(10) Maybe some of it comes from growing up on an island where there was no place to throw [4m[35m{it}[0m . 
(11) [32m{My}[0m father used to say that [1m[35m{garbage}[0m was like scotch tape . 
(12) -LRB- Shaking [35m{his}[0m thumb with an imaginary loop of tape on [3m[36m{it}[0m . -RRB- 
(13) `` You ca n't throw [1m[35m{it}[0m away , 
(14) you can only stick [1m[35m{it}[0m someplace else . '' 
(15) When [32m{I}[0m 'm [3m[32m{repairing}[0m [4m[31m{something that was designed so it ca n't be fixed}[0m , it makes [32m{me}[0m crazy . 
(16) [32m{I}[0m want to go find some enginner and marketing guy an knock heads together . 
(17) Here are a few examples . 
(18) A rototiller with gears made out of free machining brass . 
(19) Guaranteed to fail . 
(20) [1m[36m{A windshiel wiper motor installed in a totally inaccessible place under the dash .}[0m 
(21) [1m[36m{It}[0m was installed by compressing [4m[34m{four little rubber studs}[0m into holes in the sheet metal , and sealed with a ten inch oblong flat gasket . 
(22) When [4m[34m{the rubber studs}[0m rotted away , [1m[36m{the motor}[0m fell on the floor , followed by a torrent of rain that shorted out everything under [1m[33m{the dash}[0m . 
(23) A 1/4 inch diameter spring loaded shift lever detent that you had to break the tractor in half to replace . 
(24) Every piece of household plumbing and wiring [32m{I}[0m ever had to fish through a hollow wall . 
(25) Anything that can only be repaired upside down . 
(26) [31m{A twelve bolt circle on a transmission housing with six hex head bolts and six star pattern bolts .}[0m 
(27) Try and figure [31m{that}[0m out in the dark under the car . 
(28) The ignitor for [34m{the gas range}[0m that costs 25 % of what [34m{the range}[0m cost . 
(29) What 's worse is , that because [32m{I}[0m 'm good at [3m[32m{this}[0m , people think [32m{I}[0m like [3m[32m{it}[0m . 
(30) Wrong . 
(31) [32m{I}[0m hate things 
(32) and [32m{I}[0m love flesh . 
(33) [32m{I}[0m 'm convinced that things are inhabited with Gremlins . 
(34) It 's a vicious circle . 
(35) The more stuff you have the more stuff you need to maintain it , like the [3m[31m{Virginia}[0m Highways . 
(36) It starts with a screwdriver , 
(37) and next thing you know it 's a shopfull of air compressors , saws , welders , a forklift , an earthmover , a dump truck to haul the earthmover ..... 
(38) [32m{My}[0m wife takes great glee in making fun of all of this . 
(39) Then [32m{I}[0m pointed out [4m[33m{all he special purpose tools in her kithchen}[0m , 
(40) and [4m[33m{that}[0m is just for one job . 
(41) [4m[32m{She}[0m carefuly forgets all that when [4m[32m{she}[0m needs something and it turns out that [32m{I}[0m have just the right framitz to manufacture a repair piece for [4m[32m{her}[0m thing - a - bob . 
(42) [32m{I}[0m 'm convinced that we could solve our balance of payments deficits if we just passed must be repairable laws . 
(43) Every engineer should be required to be a mechanic for ten years . 
(44) For [1m[34m{many of us}[0m [1m[34m{our}[0m life has come down to buy it at Wal - mart and take it to the dump . 
(45) Even if you buy it at the BMW or John Deere dealer it is no different . 
(46) So , if PEC wants to make a supporter out of [32m{me}[0m , the way to do it is to start a campaign that ensures things do n't have to be thrown away , not one to recycle them at a loss . 
(47) [32m{I}[0m work for [1m[32m{E-Tech Recycling Inc -LRB- http://www.etechrecycling.com -RRB- , an electronics recycling company located in Virginia}[0m . 
(48) [1m[32m{We}[0m recycle all types of electronics items such as computers , monitors , TVs etc. 
(49) When [32m{I}[0m speak with [1m[31m{people}[0m about the importance of recycling electronic items , [1m[31m{they}[0m are very ignorant . 
(50) [32m{I}[0m think more than anything , we need to educate people about the importance of recycling .
