(3) Topic : [4m[32m{I}[0m am grateful to [1m[33m{the University of Science and Technology}[0m 
(4) [4m[31m{Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station}[0m -LRB- Tue Jan 2 12:18:26 2007 -RRB- , Forward . 
(5) [33m{Everybody}[0m has [33m{their}[0m own reasons for choosing a university ; because the cost of living in Hefei is cheaper , and [4m[32m{I}[0m did n't want [4m[32m{my}[0m parents to spend all [34m{their}[0m money , [4m[32m{I}[0m [3m[36m{chose}[0m [1m[33m{the University of Science and Technology of China}[0m . 
(6) Years later , looking back on [3m[36m{this choice}[0m , [4m[32m{I}[0m certainly do not have any regrets . 
(7) Perhaps if [4m[32m{I}[0m 'd chosen two schools in Beijing , [4m[32m{I}[0m would n't be here today talking about how [1m[33m{USTC}[0m is . 
(8) But [1m[33m{USTC}[0m at the time was weak ; considering location , expenses , promotion and connections , [1m[33m{USTC 's}[0m greatest wealth was [1m[33m{its}[0m students . 
(9) If [3m[35m{we}[0m had n't come forward and done something for [1m[33m{USTC}[0m , [1m[33m{it}[0m would have been finished . 
(10) This is also the main reason [1m[33m{USTC}[0m students banded together . 
(11) Because [4m[32m{I}[0m chose science and technology as [4m[32m{my}[0m career , [4m[32m{I}[0m am grateful to [1m[33m{USTC}[0m for teaching [4m[32m{me}[0m many things , and [4m[32m{I}[0m am grateful to [4m[36m{the reputation established by the previous president of the university , who enabled those who came after to benefit from it}[0m . 
(12) Precisely because [4m[32m{I}[0m feel this gratitude , [4m[32m{I}[0m want to repay [1m[33m{USTC}[0m . 
(13) [4m[32m{I}[0m regularly do [4m[32m{my}[0m job properly and do not let [1m[33m{USTC}[0m lose face . 
(14) [4m[32m{I}[0m want to save money out of [4m[32m{my}[0m meager fellowship to help [4m[34m{a poor university student}[0m with [4m[34m{his}[0m living expenses for four years . 
(15) [4m[32m{I}[0m want to go back to [1m[31m{China}[0m to make [4m[32m{my}[0m contributions ; [4m[32m{I}[0m also want to provide the needed help to future students of [4m[32m{my}[0m university . 
(16) When [4m[32m{I}[0m see [36m{people}[0m attacking [1m[33m{USTC}[0m , [4m[32m{I}[0m sometimes want to take the time to [4m[35m{defend}[0m [1m[33m{it}[0m , even though [4m[35m{that}[0m may not help much . 
(17) [36m{Those USTC haters}[0m have [36m{their}[0m own reasons ; [4m[32m{I}[0m do n't intend to change [36m{their}[0m thinking . 
(18) But with [1m[31m{China 's}[0m universities being so backward , what contributions have [4m[33m{these naysayers}[0m really made to [4m[33m{their}[0m alma maters and [4m[33m{their}[0m country ? 
(19) Like [35m{gaddy , for example , who first badmouths USTC students for not wanting to contribute money , says he himself has some money , and then wants to spend money filing a lawsuit because of a dispute over personal feelings on the bbs}[0m . 
(20) [35m{This hater}[0m really has some problems of [35m{his}[0m own . 
(21) After graduating , [4m[32m{I}[0m will go back ; no matter where [4m[32m{I}[0m work , [4m[32m{I}[0m 'm still a [1m[33m{USTC}[0m student , and [4m[32m{I}[0m have no regrets about [1m[33m{USTC}[0m and no regrets about [4m[32m{my}[0m country .

(28) [32m{I}[0m am also a [1m[33m{USTC}[0m student , but everybody has studied abroad ; there 's no need to divide up into groups and quarrel all the time . 
(29) Chinese people love to beat up on Chinese people . 
(30) [32m{I}[0m love [1m[33m{USTC}[0m , [32m{I}[0m love [1m[31m{China}[0m . 
(31) Without [1m[31m{the fatherland}[0m , there 'd be no [1m[33m{USTC}[0m -LRB- or your university -RRB- ; without [1m[33m{USTC}[0m -LRB- or your university -RRB- , there 'd be no [32m{me}[0m now . 
(32) Everybody is XDJM , so let 's not keep burning each other , OK ?
