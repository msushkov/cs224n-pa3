(0) The First Sino - Japanese War , the Russo - Japanese War and 9/18 all ended in a short time , and there were no destructive effects on [4m[36m{Japan 's}[0m economic structure . 
(1) On the other hand , each time [4m[36m{they}[0m fought , [4m[36m{they}[0m acquired a large amount of booty , which greatly increased [4m[36m{Japan 's}[0m strength . 
(2) But [31m{the War of Resistance}[0m was not like that ; [4m[36m{the Japanese}[0m were unable to support [31m{the war}[0m through fighting . 
(3) Despite [1m[35m{America 's}[0m strength and wealth , [1m[35m{it}[0m was even unable to bear the cost of the Vietnam War . 
(4) Four years of fierce fighting in [4m[31m{China}[0m had in fact left [4m[36m{Japan}[0m exhausted ; military spending was exploding , inflation at home was soaring , supplies were stretched thin , gold and foreign currency reserves were depleted , and the domestic economy was on the verge of collapse , and this enabled [1m[35m{America}[0m to throttle [4m[36m{the Japanese}[0m by the neck , meaning that [1m[35m{they}[0m forced [4m[36m{the Japanese}[0m to take a highly risky military gamble . 
(5) The outbreak of the war in [1m[34m{the Pacific}[0m was a turning point . 
(6) Since [4m[36m{Japan}[0m is an island , sea transport is [4m[36m{its}[0m lifeline , so the decisive field of battle was [1m[34m{the Pacific}[0m . 
(7) [3m[35m{The Chinese field of battle}[0m had already fulfilled [3m[35m{its}[0m mission . 
(8) [4m[31m{China}[0m did not have the strength to chase out the Japanese army . 
(9) And [4m[36m{the Japanese}[0m did not have the capability to wipe out the " Chongqing army " and the " Yan'an army . " 
(10) Both sides could only stay put and wait . 
(11) " If [3m[34m{allied forces}[0m win , [4m[31m{China}[0m can not lose ; 
(12) If [3m[34m{the allied forces}[0m lose , [4m[31m{China}[0m can not win . " 
(13) Although it upset the Americans , [4m[35m{the Kuomintang}[0m blamed [3m[33m{the Communist Party}[0m for not attacking ; [3m[33m{the Communist Party}[0m accused [4m[35m{the Kuomintang}[0m of remaining passive , but that was necessary at the time . 
(14) Although [4m[31m{we}[0m were unable to [4m[32m{drive}[0m [4m[36m{the Japanese}[0m out , because [4m[32m{this}[0m exceeded [4m[31m{China 's}[0m industrial capacity and technical and economic levels at the time , " 8/15 " is still [4m[31m{our}[0m Victory Day . 
(15) [4m[31m{Our}[0m sacrifice well deserves this victory , because [4m[31m{we}[0m made every effort . 
(16) Among the five victorious nations of the Soviet Union , [1m[35m{the United States}[0m , [4m[31m{China}[0m , [4m[34m{England}[0m and [1m[32m{France}[0m , [4m[31m{China}[0m is more qualified than [4m[34m{England}[0m and [1m[32m{France}[0m to bask in the glory of victory . 
(17) Before WWII , in the area of world industry and modern military affairs , [4m[31m{China}[0m was really unworthy of mention , not even on a par with Poland , Yugoslavia or any other mid-level European country . 
(18) [4m[31m{China 's}[0m contribution to the war against Fascism in fact far surpassed [4m[31m{its}[0m own abilities . 
(19) And [32m{this contribution}[0m was made using " blood and flesh to build [4m[31m{our}[0m new Great Wall . " 
(20) For this day , [1m[36m{millions of Chinese soldiers}[0m stained the battlefield with [1m[36m{their}[0m blood , and tens of millions of ordinary people died , billions of yuan in assets were lost : [1m[33m{it}[0m was a huge price to pay . 
(21) [4m[31m{We}[0m can not forget [4m[31m{our}[0m glory , nor can [4m[31m{we}[0m forget [1m[33m{the price we paid}[0m . 
(22) -LRB- 4 -RRB- 
(23) Several years back [4m[33m{Zhou Zuoren}[0m and [3m[36m{Zhang Ailing}[0m 's works thrilled a generation . 
(24) But some people complained that [1m[31m{they}[0m have been treated unfairly . 
(25) [1m[31m{Their}[0m works certainly appeal to the emotions and tastes of people nowadays who have gotten rich by various means , and literarily speaking [3m[31m{they}[0m could sometimes be original . 
(26) But literature is a moral force , and the integrity of [1m[31m{these easy - living social paragons}[0m is even lower than that of thieves ; [1m[31m{they}[0m certainly have no sense of duty to [1m[31m{their}[0m country , and it can even be said that [1m[31m{they}[0m have no shame . 
(27) How can [1m[31m{they}[0m expect to be respected by society as a whole ? 
(28) What kind of soul do [1m[31m{their}[0m works have ? 
(29) If we can forgive [4m[33m{Zhou Zuoren}[0m and [3m[36m{Zhang Ailing}[0m , then how , at the very worst , can we face Zhao Yiman , Yang Jingyu and Chao Shangzhi , who at the same historical period crawled over ice and slept in snow , willing to die rather than yield ? 
(30) [4m[31m{Our}[0m world is still not peaceful ; [4m[31m{our}[0m enemies are still eyeing [4m[31m{us}[0m covetously . 
(31) [3m[32m{Wang Jingwei , Zhou Zuoren , Zhang Ailing}[0m and [3m[32m{their}[0m ilk should be relegated to history 's wall of shame forever .
