(0) As we might expect from someone so radically self - estranged , the result has been nothing less than a metamorphosis . 
(1) [4m[32m{Michael 's}[0m journey of self - discovery is a work in progress like no other because [4m[31m{it}[0m increasingly depends on the accommodation of two irreconcilables : the child and adult as one . 
(2) More revealing of [4m[36m{itself}[0m than [4m[36m{its}[0m favorite target , [4m[36m{public opinion}[0m has not seen fit to grant [4m[32m{Michael}[0m the inalienable right to [4m[32m{his}[0m confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment . 
(3) If most people subscribe to the notion that black and white are not only skin colors but states of mind , why are we baffled or offended when [4m[32m{Michael , who was introduced to the white ways of Hollywood at the age of 5 ,}[0m tells us that [4m[32m{he}[0m is n't sure what [4m[32m{his}[0m true color is ? 
(4) Robbed of [4m[32m{his}[0m childhood , abused by a psychotic father and then prematurely subjected to the adult pressures of the entertainment world , why are we surprised to learn that [4m[32m{Michael}[0m does n't want to grow up , that [4m[32m{he}[0m prefers the company and community of children , that [4m[32m{he}[0m wants to be protected and looked after ? 
(5) Every time [4m[32m{the androgynous Jackson}[0m goes under the knife [4m[32m{he}[0m is crying out that [4m[32m{he}[0m does n't know if [4m[32m{he}[0m is man or woman , child or adult , black or white . 
(6) As if we would have done otherwise in [4m[32m{his}[0m situation ? 
(7) And to the never - ending suspicion that [4m[32m{Michael}[0m is a child abuser , what crime has been committed when two experimenting 11 - year - olds fool around sexually ? 
(8) If you believe that [4m[32m{Michael}[0m has the mentality of an 11 - year - old , -LRB- and there has n't been much evidence to the contrary during the past 20 years -RRB- [4m[32m{he}[0m should not have had to defend [4m[32m{himself}[0m against accusations of child molestation . 
(9) Was it in defense of perversity or [4m[32m{his}[0m incorrigible innocence that convinced [4m[32m{him}[0m that it was OK to reveal that [4m[32m{he}[0m shared [4m[32m{his}[0m bed with children ? 
(10) More questionable , even criminal , than [4m[32m{Michael}[0m 's alleged fooling around with other kids , were [4m[33m{the parents who allowed , even encouraged their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilections have been suspect since 1991}[0m . 
(11) On June 13 , 2005 , the courts found [4m[32m{Michael}[0m not guilty of the charges brought against [4m[32m{him}[0m . 
(12) However , those whose minds were decided on [4m[32m{his}[0m guilt before the trial began will not be changed by the verdict , just as [4m[32m{Michael 's}[0m essential nature will not have changed . 
(13) Mahatma Gandhi writes that ' There is [4m[34m{a higher court than courts of justice}[0m and [4m[34m{that}[0m is the court of conscience . ' 
(14) [4m[35m{Only Michael}[0m knows if [4m[35m{he}[0m is sexually attracted to children , and beyond that , if [4m[35m{he}[0m has ever acted on those feelings . 
(15) And if we grant [4m[35m{him}[0m the mental age of an 11 - year - old , who has nonetheless conventionally fathered two children , [4m[35m{Michael}[0m is then a child trapped in an adult body . 
(16) Which means the crowning act in [4m[35m{his}[0m quest for authenticity awaits one final operation . 
(17) What does [31m{a man}[0m do when [31m{he}[0m feels , acts and responds like a woman trapped in a man 's body ? 
(18) [31m{He}[0m undergoes sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' [31m{she}[0m ' is . 
(19) There remains one final procedure that will totally liberate the child that [4m[35m{Michael}[0m is . 
(20) When [4m[35m{Michael}[0m finds the courage to act on what [4m[35m{his}[0m duty toward other children demands -- submit to voluntary neutering -- which will be tantamount to [4m[35m{his}[0m final confession , the saving grace and glory that is [4m[35m{his}[0m Neverland will become [4m[35m{his}[0m forever land . 
(21) Tennessee Williams has said for all time , `` there 's not enough kindness in the world . '' 
(22) And I say this to [4m[35m{you}[0m , [4m[35m{Michael Jackson}[0m , may [4m[35m{your}[0m tribe increase .
