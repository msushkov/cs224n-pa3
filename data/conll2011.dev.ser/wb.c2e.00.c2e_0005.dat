(0) [1m[36m{Guangzhou}[0m Starts Puffing [1m[36m{Itself}[0m up -LRB- reposted from Moonlight blog -RRB- 
(1) [1m[31m{Dift Wu}[0m 
(2) [1m[31m{I}[0m went to sina.com today and suddenly saw [1m[33m{a " strange " article from China Business News : " Guangzhou to Become First Mainland City with a GDP per Capita of over 10,000 US Dollars " <http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-01-04/051211947888.shtml>}[0m . 
(3) [1m[33m{It}[0m says that the mayor of [1m[36m{Guangzhou}[0m has said that calculated by the number of people registered as residents , the GDP per capita of [1m[36m{Guangzhou}[0m this year will exceed 10,000 US dollars . 
(4) The reason [1m[31m{I}[0m thought [1m[33m{it}[0m was strange was because according to some data that [1m[31m{I}[0m already knew about <http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html> , [1m[36m{Guangzhou 's}[0m GDP per capita should only reach the target of 10,000 US dollars in 2010 . 
(5) Even though the RMB has [35m{increased}[0m in value , [35m{it}[0m still could n't be this fast . 
(6) [1m[32m{This figure}[0m must have something wrong with [1m[32m{it}[0m . 
(7) And the reason for the problem was still the population figure . 
(8) [33m{Shenzhen}[0m and other cities all calculate GDP per capita using the permanent resident population in the calculation . 
(9) For cities with such large migrant populations , a GDP per capita calculated using the number of registered residents will be very inaccurate . 
(10) If [1m[36m{Guangzhou}[0m calculates the GDP per capita using the permanent resident population , [1m[36m{it}[0m 's obviously puffing [1m[36m{itself}[0m up . 
(11) [3m[32m{People from Guangdong}[0m are usually very low - key about wealth . 
(12) [3m[32m{They}[0m 'd never compare these vanities with [36m{Beijing}[0m or [1m[35m{Shanghai}[0m . 
(13) This way , [3m[32m{they}[0m can pay a little less tax to the central authorities : keeping quiet to get rich . 
(14) In addition , everyone is very clear about the situations in [1m[36m{Guangzhou}[0m and [33m{Shenzhen}[0m . 
(15) For many years [1m[36m{Guangzhou}[0m has been just a little behind [33m{Shenzhen}[0m in [1m[36m{its}[0m economic indices and all aspects . 
(16) [1m[36m{Its}[0m GDP will soon be exceeded by [33m{Shenzhen 's}[0m , yet [1m[36m{its}[0m population has always been higher than [33m{Shenzhen 's}[0m . 
(17) [1m[31m{I}[0m remember [1m[31m{I}[0m wrote an article " The Mystery of [33m{Shenzhen 's}[0m GDP per capita <http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html> . " 
(18) [33m{Shenzhen 's}[0m GDP per capita is calculated using the number of permanent residents , and it is predicted that [34m{it}[0m wo n't top 10,000 US dollars until about 2008 . 
(19) How could [1m[36m{Guangzhou 's}[0m leaders make this kind of wild assertion ? 
(20) This kind of showing off has never been the style of people from [1m[34m{Guangdong}[0m . 
(21) Various signs show that [3m[31m{the new team of leaders in Guangzhou}[0m may have been transferred from another region . 
(22) [3m[31m{They}[0m tend to like boasting and like playing number games to seek rewards from the central authorities . 
(23) If this really is the case , then [1m[36m{Guangzhou 's}[0m prospects for economic development may be indeed not good . 
(24) Fewer empty words and more real action has always been the straightforward style of people from [1m[34m{Guangdong}[0m . 
(25) Only by keeping the wealth among the people can a nation be ultimately rich . 
(26) Making the majority of people rich is the most important . 
(27) [1m[31m{I}[0m hope [3m[31m{the new team of leaders in Guangzhou}[0m will carefully learn from the experiences and lessons of the last few administrations and not to rival with places like [36m{Beijing}[0m and [1m[35m{Shanghai}[0m in exaggeration . 
(28) Otherwise [1m[36m{Guangzhou 's}[0m development will really be a cause for worry .
