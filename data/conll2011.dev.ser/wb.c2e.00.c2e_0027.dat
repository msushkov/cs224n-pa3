(0) In the past when the local tyrants and despots among [3m[33m{the minorities}[0m were overthrown , [3m[33m{the masses of minorities}[0m and [3m[36m{the Han}[0m were equally happy . 
(1) But today [3m[33m{they}[0m find that the cadres and capitalists from [4m[32m{those years}[0m are now standing together , and the [3m[36m{Han}[0m people of the same class from [4m[32m{those years}[0m are beginning to suppress [3m[33m{them}[0m . 
(2) Of course some people say that [3m[32m{the Communist Party}[0m and most [3m[36m{Han}[0m cadres have made many contributions to the construction of border and minority areas , and have sacrificed so much . 
(3) Right , [3m[33m{the minorities}[0m should be grateful and remember the contributions of the [3m[36m{Han}[0m cadres , and this proves that any two ethnic groups can live peacefully together . 
(4) However , it can also be said that [3m[32m{the Party}[0m and the country have a duty to provide basic infrastructure and improve economic development , 
(5) because since you govern this land , and you collect taxes , do you really want to wipe your ass and leave ? 
(6) More importantly , [3m[35m{the so - called " preferential policy "}[0m can only be given by a powerful ethnic group or force . 
(7) This should be common knowledge - the people who can give are always higher - ups . 
(8) And [3m[33m{the weaker ethnic groups}[0m can only accept [3m[35m{it}[0m passively . 
(9) But let 's not mention on what basis [3m[32m{the Communist Party}[0m divided 55 ethnic groups into " minorities " !!?? 
(10) The essence of [3m[32m{our Party 's}[0m ethnic preferential policies is to permanently institute this strong - weak relationship between [3m[36m{the Han race}[0m and [3m[36m{its}[0m fraternal ethnic groups -LRB- the relationship between the center and the fringe , the governing and the governed . 
(11) Let [3m[36m{the Han race -LRB- mainly meaning the inner bureaucracy -RRB-}[0m act like the emperor , doling out to [3m[33m{the " minority "}[0m here and there . 
(12) And [3m[33m{the " minorities "}[0m can only feel deeply grateful , how will [3m[33m{they}[0m dare discuss equality !! 
(13) People who are given consideration are in mainstream eyes the weak ; as time goes by , [3m[34m{the " minorities " who are given consideration}[0m also get accustomed to this arrangement and believe that [3m[34m{they}[0m are the weak ones and should be dominated , as if [3m[34m{they}[0m were inferior !!!! 
(14) Do n't you see it , 
(15) but whenever there is some event like National Day or May First , all the ethnic groups get together in Tiananmen Square , and [1m[35m{people}[0m dress as " minorities , " wear [1m[35m{their}[0m costumes , [1m[35m{their}[0m traditional folk dress , even if [1m[35m{they}[0m have never worn [1m[36m{such outfits}[0m in [1m[35m{their}[0m daily lives . 
(16) While the [3m[36m{Han}[0m leaders and representatives are wearing Western suits and leather shoes . 
(17) What does [4m[31m{this}[0m explain ? 
(18) [4m[31m{It}[0m perfectly reflects this strong - weak relationship : [3m[36m{the Han}[0m are contemporary , and [3m[33m{the minorities}[0m are backward , stuck in the past and abnormal !!!! 
(19) This is the price to pay for being considered !!! 
(20) What need is even there to talk of abuse !!?? 
(21) All ethnic groups have been enslaved . 
(22) What else is there ? 
(23) The result of receiving consideration is the degeneration of these ethnic groups , with no hope of progress . 
(24) Do n't we really know where [3m[31m{those people}[0m got [3m[31m{their}[0m sour grapes ?
