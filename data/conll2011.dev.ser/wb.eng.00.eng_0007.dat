(0) -LRB- At least that is a widely held belief . -RRB- 
(1) b -RRB- the additional costs -LRB- for proffers and such -RRB- over and above ordinary and sufficient property taxes were carefully examined to cover only the new and extraordinary capital costs associated solely with new residents . 
(2) That means that you can not blame the new residents for increased capital costs that are really in support of new desires or needs on the part of all residents . 
(3) Say crime is up 50 % so you need [1m[34m{a new jail}[0m . 
(4) At the same time new residents are planned to be up 25 % . 
(5) How much of the cost of [1m[34m{the new jail}[0m should [4m[34m{the new residents}[0m pay ? 
(6) Are you going to hold [4m[34m{them}[0m responsible for the 50 % of increased need that is due to existing residents ? 
(7) [4m[32m{I}[0m understand [3m[35m{Larry}[0m 's point , 
(8) but [4m[32m{I}[0m think it is intellectually too easy to be correct . 
(9) [4m[32m{I}[0m particularly like this : [1m[35m{Another way of looking at this is that if new folks had to pay their actual share of infrastructure costs - there would be less money for bigger homes and new SUV and long solo commutes}[0m . 
(10) [1m[35m{That}[0m is absolutely correct , 
(11) and [1m[35m{it}[0m corresponds to EMR 's gloomy prediction that we will all face lowered expectations . 
(12) But what if the choice is a smaller home in the exurbs and a hybrid ? 
(13) [1m[35m{It}[0m is a fine argument , 
(14) but [4m[32m{I}[0m do n't think we know anywhere near enough to actually and fairly assess the costs of new infrastructure , on the one hand . 
(15) On the other hand , if [4m[33m{the newcomers}[0m pay for [4m[33m{their}[0m own infrastructure , especially if we *require* [4m[33m{them}[0m to pay for [4m[33m{their}[0m own infrastructure , then we should not be too surprised if [4m[33m{they}[0m claim to own [4m[35m{it}[0m and wish to exclude us . 
(16) This has already happened with [4m[36m{some gated communities}[0m . 
(17) [4m[36m{They}[0m provided [3m[33m{things like bike paths}[0m , and now the outside community wants connectivity to [3m[33m{those assets}[0m without picking up part of the costs . 
(18) It is the same with riparian setbacks and other increased demands on private income or property . 
(19) [4m[32m{I}[0m do n't see how we can expect it to be shared infrastructure that we all benefit from unless we [3m[36m{share}[0m some of the costs . 
(20) At present , we ca n't even agree on what `` some of '' amounts to , let alone if [3m[36m{it}[0m is a fair distribution . 
(21) What if the choice is between a larger home and an SUV in the exurbs or a smaller home and maybe no car in the inner areas , AND AT A HIGHER PRICE , including travel ? 
(22) [3m[32m{Policy Soup}[0m hsa a comment on the same subject that says , `` [3m[32m{I}[0m lived in [32m{Crystal City}[0m for many years after college . 
(23) The Underground was , and remains , the greatest feature . 
(24) The only drawback to [32m{Crystal City}[0m was no yards . 
(25) The location was great , but [32m{the place}[0m was too urban for anyone with a family . 
(26) The higher density development that has been going on there for the past five years or so is a crime - 
(27) you ca n't even cross the street on foot , everything is so congested ! 
(28) So much for the `` pedestrian friendly '' model - 
(29) Arlington seems determined to kill pedestrians , forcing people who used to walk to drive two blocks like in Clarnedon due to overcrowding . 
(30) Let 's pray [1m[36m{they}[0m stop compounding [1m[36m{their}[0m errors , lest the whole place decline . '' 
(31) It may turn out that we need more space not just to live and travel , but to make way for difference of opinion . 
(32) re : newcomers / infrastructure / longevity 
(33) Well .. [3m[35m{I}[0m do n't think infrastructure `` wears out '' in the usual sense but [3m[35m{I}[0m do accept the premise for some things . 
(34) [31m{Roads and water / sewer}[0m are not replaced . 
(35) [31m{They}[0m are , instead , maintained . 
(36) Schools and Prisons and other buildings can eventually wear out and need replacement . 
(37) But [3m[35m{I}[0m am talking about new infrastructure that would not be needed if an area was not experiencing growth . 
(38) All communities have CIPs -LRB- capital investment plans -RRB- for infrastructure - both replacement and but replacement infrastructure IS something that can be accomodated in an annual budget - much like figuring out how many buses the school system needs to replace - every year - 
(39) it 's a known calculation . 
(40) But [3m[34m{new infrastructure}[0m is not because [3m[34m{it}[0m depends on the RATE of growth 
(41) and [3m[35m{I}[0m think there would be strenuous disagreement with the claim that `` That means that you can not blame the new residents for increased capital costs that are really in support of new desires or needs on the part of all residents . '' 
(42) because [3m[31m{existing residents}[0m are not getting `` better '' levels of services but rather expensive measures necessary to simply maintain [3m[31m{their}[0m existing levels of service . 
(43) Most communities would not willinging choose nor think fair that it is the existing residents ' financial responsibility to pay for new infrastructure for new residents . 
(44) Remember , we 're not talking about a new classroom to replace the older , worn - out one . 
(45) We 're talking about a new ADDITIONAL classroom .
