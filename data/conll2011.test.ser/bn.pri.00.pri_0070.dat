(0) [35m{This}[0m is The World . 
(1) I am Lisa Mullins . 
(2) [1m[33m{Both George W. Bush}[0m and [32m{Al Gore}[0m [1m[34m{today}[0m continue to press [4m[36m{their}[0m cases literally and figuratively . 
(3) [4m[36m{Their}[0m PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly . 
(4) [1m[32m{Governor Bush 's running mate}[0m [1m[32m{Dick Cheney}[0m [31m{talked}[0m with reporters about [3m[35m{the Republican transition plans}[0m , [31m{another signal that Bush is getting ready to become the next President of the United States}[0m . 
(5) Meanwhile , [32m{Vice President Gore}[0m continued [32m{his}[0m appeal for patience while [32m{he}[0m contests [1m[33m{Bush 's}[0m claim to victory , and attorneys for [4m[36m{both men}[0m were preparing for key court battles later in the week , which could settle the three - week dispute over who won [4m[33m{Florida}[0m and the presidency . 
(6) [35m{The World 's}[0m Clark Boyd has the latest . 
(7) All eyes were on [4m[33m{Florida}[0m yet again [1m[34m{today}[0m as lawyers , judges , lawmakers and citizens , all picked at the knots that have tied up the conclusion of [1m[32m{this presidential election}[0m for the past three weeks . 
(8) Yesterday in [33m{Leon County Circuit Court}[0m , [3m[34m{Judge N. Sander Sauls}[0m set a [1m[33m{Saturday}[0m deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered [1m[36m{the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and Palm Beach counties}[0m , not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth , to be brought to [31m{Tallahassee}[0m under police escort . 
(9) [1m[34m{Today}[0m , as officials in [1m[31m{both two counties}[0m ready [1m[36m{the ballots}[0m for transport , [1m[33m{George W. Bush 's}[0m lawyers asked [3m[34m{the judge}[0m to [1m[35m{order}[0m all 1.16 million ballots from [1m[31m{the two counties}[0m to be trucked to [31m{the state capital}[0m . 
(10) Late this afternoon , [3m[34m{Judge Sauls}[0m granted [1m[35m{that motion}[0m . 
(11) In [4m[31m{Washington}[0m , [32m{Vice President Al Gore}[0m was back on television this morning trying to shore up public support for [32m{his}[0m legal cause . 
(12) In a taped interview , for NBC 's Today Show , [32m{Gore}[0m said despite all the legal maneuvering [32m{he}[0m is calling on [4m[34m{both camps}[0m to put partisan politics aside . 
(13) [32m{I}[0m think that [4m[36m{both Governor Bush and I}[0m should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of [4m[36m{our}[0m partisan supporters . 
(14) Meanwhile , [1m[33m{Bush 's}[0m vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy man [1m[34m{today}[0m . 
(15) After a heart checkup at a [4m[31m{Washington}[0m hospital [4m[32m{he}[0m appeared at a news conference to say that [4m[32m{he}[0m is pressing ahead with [3m[35m{transition plans}[0m . 
(16) [35m{We}[0m have now acquired [36m{office space in McClain , Virginia that will become the site for the transition operation that we announced two days ago}[0m , so [35m{we}[0m are just in a business of getting up and running , but [35m{we}[0m now have [36m{an office with a lot of space}[0m . 
(17) [35m{We}[0m have got people signing up , volunteers coming on , telephones being put in and computers , so [35m{we}[0m will be fully operational within the next day or two . 
(18) Earlier today in [4m[33m{Florida}[0m , [3m[33m{the Republican dominated legislature}[0m began hearings on calling a special session to [34m{pick}[0m [4m[33m{the state 's}[0m electors [3m[33m{itself}[0m , should the December 12th deadline still find [1m[32m{the election}[0m tied up in the courts . 
(19) [3m[33m{The committee}[0m heard from angry voters and precinct workers in [33m{Palm Beach}[0m . 
(20) [4m[35m{I}[0m believe our issues do relate directly to [34m{the appointing of electors for the state of Florida}[0m . 
(21) [3m[36m{The electors}[0m need to be appointed , are supposed to be appointed according to [32m{the will of the people}[0m and [4m[35m{I}[0m believe in [33m{Palm Beach County}[0m that it was very difficult to determine what [32m{the will of the people}[0m was . 
(22) Although [32m{Al Gore}[0m said [1m[34m{today}[0m that [32m{he}[0m certainly feels like [32m{he}[0m won [1m[32m{the election}[0m , [32m{he}[0m put [32m{his}[0m odds of wining the various legal battles at fifty - fifty . 
(23) [32m{Gore}[0m said , if [1m[33m{Bush}[0m does triumph in court , [32m{he}[0m will throw [32m{his}[0m support behind [1m[33m{the Republican President - elect}[0m . 
(24) But for now , says [3m[31m{former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche}[0m , [4m[34m{both sides}[0m are positive that [4m[34m{they}[0m 've won [1m[32m{the election}[0m , and says [3m[31m{Riche}[0m , the longer [36m{the fight}[0m goes on , the more troublesome the next four years might be . 
(25) What [1m[31m{we}[0m risk by prolonging [36m{this}[0m is greater public cynicism and a hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to work together . 
(26) After all , come January , these people are going to have to be in [4m[31m{Washington}[0m whether [32m{Gore}[0m or [1m[33m{Bush}[0m is [3m[32m{the President}[0m . 
(27) You have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work together with [3m[32m{the new President}[0m and with each other , so [1m[31m{we}[0m do n't want to prolong [36m{this}[0m forever . 
(28) The US Supreme Court will hear arguments from [4m[34m{both sides}[0m on Friday and [4m[33m{Florida 's}[0m Leon County Circuit Court will consider the arguments on [1m[36m{disputed state ballots}[0m on [1m[33m{Saturday}[0m , and while the nation wearies of the protracted legal battle maybe [33m{Leon County Circuit Court}[0m judge N. Sander Sauls said it best . 
(29) The whole process , [3m[34m{he}[0m said , is a bit like being nibbled to death by a duck . 
(30) For [35m{The World}[0m , [34m{this}[0m is Clark Boyd .
