(0) We turn now to an Iraqi -- 
(1) First of all , before [32m{we}[0m tell you about this story , [32m{we}[0m were going to , [35m{these}[0m are live pictures from [31m{Baghdad}[0m . 
(2) There 's been some activity in [1m[33m{the last few moments}[0m . 
(3) Looks like tracer fire we 're looking at , anti-aircraft guns firing at what they sense is some sort of threat coming from the skies . 
(4) [31m{Baghdad}[0m has had sporadic episodes of this tonight . 
(5) No major explosions we 're aware of , but just , apparently , in [1m[33m{the last few moments}[0m , there has been [33m{activity}[0m . 
(6) You can see [33m{it}[0m there just now . 
(7) We 've been reporting , [31m{the city}[0m has begun to see [31m{its}[0m electricity turned back on . 
(8) We do n't know that all of [36m{it}[0m is back , but at least some of [36m{it}[0m is . 
(9) We also know that 12 miles southwest of [31m{the city}[0m , coalition forces remain largely in control of what was formerly [1m[32m{Saddam Hussein International Airport}[0m , now renamed by [1m[31m{the coalition}[0m [1m[32m{Baghdad International Airport}[0m , but [1m[31m{the coalition}[0m is quick to point out that [1m[31m{they}[0m do not have control of the area immediately surrounding [1m[32m{the airport}[0m . 
(10) Again , [35m{these}[0m are live pictures of [31m{Baghdad , where it is well into the night}[0m . 
(11) [34m{We}[0m 're , of course , going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything [34m{we}[0m learn .
