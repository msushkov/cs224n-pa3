(0) Here in the United States , it 's just a week and a day before Americans go to the polls to fill offices from local school boards to Congress and the President . 
(1) In the latest daily CNN USA Today Gallup popular opinion survey , [1m[31m{George W Bush , the Governor of Texas , the Republican nominee ,}[0m holds a 49 % to 42 % advantage over [1m[31m{his}[0m Democratic opponent Al Gore , the Vice President , but two other major surveys gave [1m[31m{Mr. Bush}[0m only a one - point lead . 
(2) On [3m[36m{Sunday}[0m , [36m{several major newspapers}[0m weighed in with [36m{their}[0m endorsements and [4m[34m{VOA 's}[0m Peter Hymline has that story . 
(3) In [4m[31m{its}[0m [3m[36m{Sunday}[0m editions , [4m[31m{the New York Times}[0m calls [1m[35m{Vice President Gore}[0m , the man best equipped for [1m[32m{the presidency}[0m by virtue of [1m[35m{his}[0m knowledge of government , [1m[35m{his}[0m experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision making and [1m[35m{his}[0m devotion to the general welfare . 
(4) [3m[31m{The Times editorial}[0m says [1m[35m{Mr. Gore}[0m has , in [3m[31m{its}[0m words , struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the [3m[34m{Clinton}[0m administration 's ethical lapses . 
(5) [4m[31m{The paper 's}[0m editorial board goes on to say , [1m[34m{we}[0m believe [1m[35m{Mr. Gore}[0m would never follow [3m[34m{Bill Clinton 's}[0m example of reckless conduct that cheapens [1m[32m{the Presidency}[0m . 
(6) [4m[31m{The Times}[0m also praise [1m[31m{Republican candidate George W Bush}[0m for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but [1m[34m{the writers}[0m said [1m[34m{they}[0m had concluded [1m[31m{Mr. Bush 's}[0m agenda was harsh on issues such as women 's rights , guns , and law enforcement . 
(7) [4m[31m{The Times}[0m joins [1m[36m{the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave its backing to Mr. Gore}[0m .

(10) In [3m[35m{its}[0m editorial , [3m[35m{The Chicago Tribune}[0m called [1m[35m{Mr. Gore}[0m a decent man but concluded that , in [3m[35m{its}[0m words , [1m[35m{his}[0m penchant for enhancement has become something of a running joke . 
(11) [3m[32m{The Tribune endorsement}[0m says this is an election about honesty , about restoring bipartisanship , about fostering government that will nurture a booming economy without getting in the way of American ingenuity . 
(12) [3m[35m{The paper}[0m concludes that there is [1m[31m{one candidate who will do that}[0m and [1m[31m{that}[0m is George W Bush . 
(13) The battle of the editorials reflects what many political analysts predict will be one of the closest Presidential races in decades . 
(14) Most opinion polls give [1m[31m{Mr. Bush}[0m a slight lead but [35m{a just released survey by Newsweek magazine}[0m puts the text . 
(15) [35m{The Newsweek poll}[0m indicates [4m[32m{voters}[0m consider [1m[35m{Vice President Gore}[0m the more intelligent candidate , but [4m[32m{they}[0m see [1m[31m{Governor Bush}[0m as more honest . 
(16) [4m[33m{Peter Hymline}[0m , [4m[34m{VOA News}[0m , Washington .
