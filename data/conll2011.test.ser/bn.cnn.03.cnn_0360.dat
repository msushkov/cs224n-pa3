(0) Let [3m[35m{'s}[0m talk a little bit more about what [4m[34m{the Navy}[0m does to prevent such tragedies . 
(1) [3m[35m{We}[0m were talking about it this morning and [3m[35m{we}[0m put together some graphics for you . 
(2) [1m[32m{I}[0m 'll try to explain it the best [1m[32m{I}[0m can from what [1m[32m{I}[0m remember from being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln '' . 
(3) This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what [4m[34m{the Navy}[0m does with regard to prevention . 
(4) , [3m[32m{every sailor that 's entering the Navy}[0m does take [3m[33m{a swim test}[0m . 
(5) [3m[32m{They}[0m learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and [3m[32m{they}[0m have to pass [3m[33m{that}[0m in order to continue on . 
(6) Also drills take place before [31m{sailors}[0m get on to any ship , before any deployment . 
(7) Usually twice a day , [31m{they}[0m 're practicing [33m{man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place}[0m and as the deployment begins , [33m{those}[0m wane off , but [31m{they}[0m know where to go quickly . 
(8) [31m{They}[0m also wear [1m[31m{float coats}[0m . 
(9) You can see [1m[31m{them}[0m here . 
(10) The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat . 
(11) Everything is color coordinated . 
(12) You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and [1m[31m{they}[0m have [3m[31m{toggles to pull and inflate}[0m . 
(13) [1m[31m{They}[0m also have a manual device so if [3m[31m{the toggles}[0m do n't work [4m[32m{they}[0m can blow air into the inflation device . 
(14) [4m[32m{They}[0m have [3m[34m{dive goggles}[0m and [4m[32m{they}[0m 're able to find [3m[34m{them}[0m . 
(15) It also has a strobe light and a whistle . 
(16) Also such location devices , [1m[33m{some ships}[0m have smoke floats [1m[33m{they}[0m can toss out so [4m[35m{the man overboard}[0m will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to , let the rescuer locate [4m[35m{them}[0m . 
(17) Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout [32m{the ship}[0m , all around [32m{the ship}[0m , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of [32m{the ship}[0m , not all around [32m{the entire ship}[0m , but on most parts there is a very thick netting . 
(18) Now let [3m[35m{'s}[0m talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation . 
(19) You will hear a P.A. announcement around [32m{the entire ship}[0m , there is [35m{a man overboard}[0m so [4m[36m{everyone}[0m knows [4m[36m{they}[0m have to react quickly . 
(20) A ship - wide search will happen if [34m{they}[0m do n't see [35m{that person}[0m go overboard , but if indeed [34m{they}[0m do see someone go overboard , [32m{the ship}[0m starts to circle that area continuously . 
(21) Also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , [1m[34m{helicopters}[0m are launched immediately . 
(22) Inside [1m[34m{those helicopters}[0m [3m[36m{rescue swimmers}[0m . 
(23) If indeed [35m{the man overboard}[0m is located , well the hoister is dropped down with [4m[33m{usually a torso harness}[0m . 
(24) If [35m{the man overboard}[0m is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely [3m[36m{those swimmers}[0m will go right into the water and try and help the [35m{swimmer}[0m hook up on [4m[33m{that harness}[0m and pull [35m{them}[0m up into the helo and pull [35m{them}[0m back on to [32m{the ship}[0m for treatment and usually [4m[31m{a search}[0m takes about 24 hours . 
(25) The search crews will go 24 hours before calling off [4m[31m{that search}[0m . 
(26) Why call [4m[31m{it}[0m off ? 
(27) There 's a number of reasons to look at . 
(28) Depending on the water temperature , it 's very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time . 
(29) Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is [36m{they}[0m fail [36m{they}[0m 've exhausted all resources by that time . 
(30) Anyway , [3m[35m{we}[0m 'll continue to follow what 's happening on the `` USS Nassau '' as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors .
