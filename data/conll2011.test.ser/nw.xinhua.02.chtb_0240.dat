(0) Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , [1m[32m{April 23rd}[0m 
(1) [1m[32m{Today}[0m , [4m[33m{the Association of the Relationship between the Two Sides of the Straits}[0m sent [1m[36m{a letter}[0m to [4m[35m{the Foundation for the Exchange across the Straits}[0m to exchange views on the matters of life and property loss of mainland compatriots and Taiwanese compatriots . 
(2) [1m[36m{The communique}[0m said that on April 12th the [4m[33m{Straits Association}[0m director expressed that [4m[33m{the Straits Association}[0m agreed in principle , after [33m{both sides}[0m implement necessary preparations , to exchange views about the matter of contact and exchange between [34m{both sides of the Straits}[0m concerning life and property loss of mainland compatriots and Taiwanese compatriots in recent years . 
(3) [4m[33m{The Straits Association}[0m holds that , now , [33m{both sides}[0m should first agree on topics and content of exchanging views , and then come back to consider issues such as staff levels and time , place , etc . 
(4) If [33m{both sides}[0m can not reach an agreement on topics and content , it would not be possible to find common points in exchanging views . 
(5) This type of discussion is not what compatriots from [34m{both sides}[0m are happy to see . 
(6) [4m[33m{The Straits Association}[0m believes that the content of the exchange of views should include : 
(7) Firstly , to exchange views on the issues of tourism and contact on [34m{both sides of the Straits}[0m , including travel safety issues of compatriots from [34m{both sides}[0m . 
(8) As early as the first working discussion , at the end of August of [4m[36m{last year}[0m , when [1m[35m{the two associations}[0m implemented [36m{the " Wang - Gu Talks "}[0m , [4m[33m{the Straits Association}[0m put forward in the " schedule for the discussion on implementing relevant agreements of [36m{the Wang - Gu Talks "}[0m that [1m[35m{the associations}[0m should conduct specific discussions about " issues on strengthening tourism and contact on [34m{both sides}[0m " as soon as possible , but so far [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation 's}[0m response has not been received . 
(9) Secondly , [4m[33m{the Straits Association}[0m persistently advocates completely implementing discussions of topics about routine and economy , science and technology stipulated in the " common agreement of [36m{the Wang - Gu talks}[0m " , and has suggested many times to [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m that discussions on the " rights of Taiwanese merchants investing in [31m{the mainland}[0m and related issues " should be started early . 
(10) [4m[33m{Our association}[0m holds that the personal and property safety of Taiwanese merchants investing in [31m{the mainland}[0m have legal safeguards , and if [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m felt it was needed , [4m[35m{it}[0m could exchange views while discussing " Rights of Taiwanese merchants investing in [31m{the mainland}[0m and related issues " . 
(11) Thirdly , [4m[33m{the Straits Association}[0m has repeatedly requested that [1m[35m{both associations}[0m should conduct consultative discussions on issues of the Taiwanese military killing and wounding mainland coastal fishermen and causing serious life and property losses in recent years . 
(12) Since establishing [4m[33m{the Straits Association}[0m , [4m[33m{it}[0m has continuously pointed out such inhumane behavior to [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m which seriously hurts feelings of compatriots of [34m{both sides}[0m and breaks the harmonious atmosphere on [34m{both sides}[0m , so as to attract the attention of relevant Taiwanese areas on compensating for losses , finding those responsible , and severely punishing the assailants . 
(13) [4m[33m{It}[0m has appealed to stop such violence at the root through negotiation between [1m[35m{the two associations}[0m . 
(14) However , up to now , [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation 's}[0m response has not been received . 
(15) [1m[36m{The communique}[0m clearly points out that in the above issues involving rights of compatriots of [34m{both sides of the Straits}[0m in contact and exchange , personal safety is included , so as for the long delay in starting discussions , the fault is not with [4m[33m{the Straits Association}[0m . 
(16) [1m[36m{The communique}[0m says that current methods of contact and co-operation between [1m[35m{the two associations}[0m must strictly follow [32m{the " regulation agreement of contact and talks between the two associations " signed last year}[0m . 
(17) Since [1m[34m{the " QianDao Lake Incident "}[0m occurred , [4m[33m{the Straits Association}[0m has , according to [32m{the agreement}[0m , reported the situation to [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m , explaining and answering a certain number of questions and requests brought up by [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m . 
(18) However , [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m has repeatedly [1m[31m{raised}[0m demands that exceed [32m{the above agreement of the two associations}[0m . 
(19) Despite being reminded by [4m[33m{the Straits Association}[0m , [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m still repeatedly persists . 
(20) [1m[31m{This}[0m is a practice that disrespects [32m{the agreement between the two associations}[0m . 
(21) It is continually hoped that the contact and co-operation of [1m[35m{the two associations}[0m can be conducted in accordance with [32m{the current agreement}[0m . 
(22) [1m[36m{The communique}[0m points out that as far as [1m[34m{the " QianDao Lake Incident "}[0m is concerned , the top priority is investigating and settling [1m[33m{the case}[0m in accordance with the law . 
(23) At the same time , to express further goodwill , [4m[33m{the Straits Association}[0m has proactively [4m[34m{invited}[0m [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m and relevant experts to come to Zhejiang . 
(24) [4m[33m{The Straits Association}[0m will arrange experts ' to be presented with the details of [1m[34m{the incident}[0m and reply to questions . 
(25) If [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m is willing to know the details of [1m[33m{this case}[0m and sincerely understands the feelings of dependents of those who perished , then it is difficult to understand why [4m[35m{it}[0m again sets up prerequisites ? 
(26) [4m[33m{The Straits Association}[0m again reaffirms [4m[34m{the above invitation}[0m , and hopes that [4m[35m{the Straits Foundation}[0m would soon provide the date of [4m[35m{its}[0m departure and the name list . 
(27) According to relevant sources , currently , the three suspected criminals have been arrested , and a trial will soon be carried out according to legal procedure .
