(0) The seminar attendants also examined [4m[32m{Taiwan 's}[0m domestic situation . 
(1) [3m[33m{Versatile author and cultural commentator Ping Lu}[0m offered some very incisive comments regarding [3m[31m{the post-election protests outside the KMT headquarters}[0m . 
(2) In demanding that Lee Teng - hui resign as chairman of [3m[32m{the KMT}[0m to take responsibility for the election defeat , [3m[33m{Ping -LRB- herself a second - generation " mainlander " -RRB-}[0m argued that [3m[31m{the protest}[0m revealed an ethnic fault line in Taiwanese society . 
(3) [3m[31m{It}[0m was a venting of mass frustration on the part of [3m[36m{one particular ethnic group}[0m , said [3m[33m{Ping}[0m , noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders . 
(4) [3m[36m{This group}[0m feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of [3m[32m{KMT}[0m rule [3m[36m{they}[0m have always thought of [3m[36m{themselves}[0m as a privileged " majority " in [4m[32m{Taiwan}[0m even though in fact [3m[36m{they}[0m are a minority . 
(5) [3m[36m{They}[0m do not identify with [4m[32m{Taiwan}[0m as [3m[36m{their}[0m home , and [3m[36m{they}[0m have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority . 
(6) In some ways [4m[31m{the election}[0m has forced [3m[36m{them}[0m to [4m[33m{realize}[0m that [3m[36m{they}[0m truly are a minority . 
(7) [4m[33m{This development}[0m should help to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in [4m[32m{Taiwan}[0m . 
(8) The participants generally felt that [4m[31m{the election}[0m was a victory for democracy . 
(9) On the domestic front , [3m[34m{the victory of Chen Shui - bian}[0m showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort to banish " black gold " from the political arena . 
(10) In cross-strait relations [4m[34m{Chen 's}[0m victory spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted within the framework of a civil war between [3m[32m{he KMT}[0m and the Chinese Communist Party . 
(11) Reform of [3m[32m{the KMT}[0m and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in [4m[32m{Taiwan}[0m . 
(12) It appears that [3m[35m{the people of Taiwan}[0m have finally taken [3m[35m{their}[0m first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect .
