(0) [4m[36m{The `` USS Cole ''}[0m is on [4m[36m{its}[0m long journey home [31m{tonight}[0m , sitting atop a rescue ship , and now , for the first time , [4m[36m{its}[0m open wound fully visible . 
(1) [3m[36m{NBC 's}[0m Jim Miklaszewski [31m{tonight}[0m at the Pentagon with an exclusive report on [36m{the damage done}[0m and the difficulty in finding [4m[31m{those responsible}[0m . 
(2) [3m[33m{Jim ?}[0m 
(3) What 's the latest there ? 
(4) [4m[33m{New pictures}[0m reveal the sheer power of that terrorist bomb that ripped through [4m[36m{the `` USS Cole}[0m . '' 
(5) For the first time , with [4m[36m{the `` Cole ''}[0m out of the water , [4m[34m{the full impact of the catastrophic blast}[0m clearly visible . 
(6) In [4m[33m{these photos obtained by NBC News}[0m , [36m{the damage}[0m much larger than first imagined , extending well below the water line . 
(7) Workers on deck dwarfed by [4m[34m{the 40 x 60 - foot gaping wound}[0m . 
(8) Large sections of the hull buckled inward . 
(9) Crewman Sean Powell , back home in Florida , says inside [4m[36m{the `` Cole}[0m , '' it was chaos , it got dark , we lost power , [4m[36m{ship}[0m [3m[34m{started}[0m to list , [3m[34m{that}[0m 's what scared everybody . 
(10) Despite [36m{the devastating damage}[0m , Navy officials predict [4m[36m{the `` Cole ''}[0m can be repaired for about $ 150 million , and put back into service . 
(11) Justice Department officials say in [4m[35m{Yemen}[0m , [34m{the FBI 's investigation}[0m is dead in the water . 
(12) Senior U.S. officials tell [3m[36m{NBC News}[0m [4m[35m{the Yemen government}[0m has all but shut down [3m[35m{all cooperation in finding those behind the `` Cole '' attack}[0m . 
(13) Evidence is either withheld or tampered with . 
(14) [4m[32m{A surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the attack}[0m was so heavily edited , [4m[32m{it}[0m did n't even show [35m{the blast itself}[0m . 
(15) Why ? 
(16) [4m[35m{Yemen}[0m is a terrorist hotbed , and some members of [32m{President Saleh 's}[0m own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists . 
(17) It 's hard to see exactly why it is that [32m{the President there}[0m would ever want to cooperate with the United States and possibly put [32m{himself}[0m in jeopardy . 
(18) Reporter : 
(19) And even though [3m[35m{cooperation from Yemen}[0m is at a standstill , [33m{U.S. officials}[0m tell [3m[36m{NBC News}[0m that [33m{they}[0m are making substantial progress in [34m{the investigation}[0m and are fully confident [33m{they}[0m will get enough evidence to retaliate against [4m[31m{those responsible}[0m . 
(20) Tom ? 
(21) Thanks very much , [3m[36m{NBC 's}[0m Jim Miklaszewski [31m{tonight}[0m .
