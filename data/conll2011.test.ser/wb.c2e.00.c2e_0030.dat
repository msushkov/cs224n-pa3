(3) Title : [1m[33m{ZT Han Han}[0m : Car Knowledge and Manifestation of Life -LRB- Regarding [1m[35m{the car accident involving that beautiful/talented Taiwanese girl}[0m -RRB- 
(4) [4m[36m{Poster 's}[0m Site : mitbbs.com BBS -LRB- Wed Jan 31 11:16:04 2007 -RRB- 
(5) A few days ago , [4m[35m{another Taiwanese star}[0m [3m[35m{passed}[0m away . 
(6) [4m[36m{I}[0m had never heard of [4m[35m{her}[0m . 
(7) [4m[36m{I}[0m hear [4m[35m{she}[0m was a talented beauty . 
(8) What a great pity ! 
(9) [1m[35m{The accident}[0m was a car crash . 
(10) Much of the entertainment news denounced that [4m[35m{+her}[0m car 's front airbag failed to release , which caused [3m[35m{the death}[0m . 
(11) In fact , [3m[32m{the MINI COOPER she was riding in}[0m is not what the reports said . 
(12) [1m[34m{It}[0m is the car with the highest safety index . 
(13) [1m[34m{It}[0m is sold for 190,000 HK dollars in Hong Kong . 
(14) Polo also sells for more than 140,000 HK dollars . 
(15) [1m[34m{It}[0m 's just a cute little car , preferred by girls . 
(16) But safety is surely not too big of a problem . 
(17) The collision happened on the side and rear . 
(18) So , [3m[36m{the side airbag and air curtain}[0m were fully opened . 
(19) [3m[36m{They}[0m opened at the time of [3m[31m{first collision with the protective fence}[0m . 
(20) [3m[31m{The first collision}[0m was with [3m[34m{the protective fence only}[0m , and the impact on the people was very small . 
(21) In addition , there was the protection of [1m[31m{the air curtain}[0m . 
(22) So , there would surely not be a big problem . 
(23) [31m{The real fatal collision}[0m was the second one from the tailgating truck . 
(24) At that time , all the airbags were already deflated . 
(25) There was no protective effect . 
(26) Furthermore , the force of [31m{this one}[0m was extremely large . 
(27) If [3m[32m{the car}[0m had been stopped at an angle , then the head of the person sitting on one side would surely have hit the glass or the B column . 
(28) Meanwhile , there would not have been too much of a problem for someone on the other side . 
(29) This is common knowledge . 
(30) Then it came down to who had the bad luck of sitting on the side of [33m{the car}[0m that was angled out . 
(31) It was perfectly correct for [4m[31m{the front airbag}[0m not to open , because the front of [33m{the car}[0m was not damaged at all . 
(32) None of the sensors received any signal of a collision . 
(33) Just imagine , this was a rear collision . 
(34) [4m[33m{The people}[0m went backward abruptly . 
(35) [4m[33m{Their}[0m bodies could have been supported by the seats , but the impact on [4m[33m{their}[0m necks and heads was tremendous . 
(36) When [4m[33m{they}[0m went abruptly backward , any additional misfortune of [4m[31m{the front airbag}[0m opening for no reason would have eliminated any chance of survival . 
(37) So , of all the cars in the world , even a Rolls - Royce , [1m[32m{the front airbag}[0m will not open during a rear collision . 
(38) If [1m[32m{the front airbag}[0m [35m{opened}[0m after being tailgated , [35m{that}[0m would be a quality problem , and would be extremely dangerous . 
(39) The safety airbag 's eruption could knock someone to death . 
(40) So , infants are strictly forbidden from sitting in the front seat . 
(41) That was how the whole accident took place . 
(42) The result of the accident investigation division will not be different from this . 
(43) For this kind of accident , conclusions can be drawn from a single glance at the car wreckage . 
(44) [33m{The car}[0m and [3m[33m{the car manufacturer}[0m have no fault . 
(45) [36m{All of the car 's passive safety protections}[0m had already fully carried out [36m{their}[0m functions . 
(46) So , it is extremely ridiculous and unscientific to blame and suspect [33m{the car}[0m and [3m[33m{the car manufacturer}[0m for such an accident . 
(47) In particular , speculation about why [34m{the front airbags}[0m did not open was very amateurish . 
(48) Only by not opening would it have been correct . 
(49) If [34m{they}[0m had opened , [4m[35m{her}[0m assistant might still be lying in the hospital . 
(50) If an accident occurs on the freeway , please get out of the car and leave immediately if you can move . 
(51) Many freeway accidents occur simply because [32m{people}[0m stay inside the car and sort out [32m{their}[0m thoughts , following which there is a fatal crash from a car following behind . 
(52) About death , [4m[36m{I}[0m have always believed that [4m[34m{they}[0m do not leave [1m[36m{the world}[0m . 
(53) [4m[34m{They}[0m only leave the human world . 
(54) [4m[34m{They}[0m are surely sharing [1m[36m{the same world}[0m with us , with a different manifestation of life . 
(55) -- 
(56) It is in change that we find purpose .
