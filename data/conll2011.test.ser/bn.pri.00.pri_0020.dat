(0) This is [1m[32m{The World}[0m . 
(1) [31m{I}[0m am Tony Kahn . 
(2) [4m[34m{Novelist and playwright Gao Xingjian}[0m [4m[31m{today}[0m became the first Chinese language author to win the Nobel Prize for Literature . 
(3) [4m[34m{Gao Xingjian 's}[0m avant - garde plays made [4m[34m{him}[0m persona non-grata in [4m[34m{his}[0m native China and [4m[34m{he}[0m fled [3m[33m{the country}[0m in 1988 . 
(4) [4m[34m{He}[0m settled in [3m[34m{France}[0m becoming a French citizen two years ago . 
(5) [4m[32m{Gregory Lee}[0m is a professor of [35m{Chinese}[0m and Chinese literature at [36m{the University of Lyons in France}[0m . 
(6) [4m[32m{Professor Lee}[0m , [31m{I}[0m gather [4m[32m{you}[0m know [4m[34m{the man}[0m and know [4m[34m{his}[0m work . 
(7) Tell [1m[32m{us}[0m a little bit about [4m[34m{him}[0m , Who is [4m[34m{he}[0m and why did [4m[34m{he}[0m flee [3m[33m{China}[0m . 
(8) [4m[34m{Gao Xingjian}[0m is quite an interesting writer because in some senses [4m[34m{he}[0m differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in the West today . 
(9) [4m[32m{I}[0m would say that the great difference about [4m[34m{Gao Xingjian}[0m is that [4m[34m{he}[0m actually received a university education . 
(10) [4m[34m{He}[0m was educated in French , so has a very good knowledge of French literature and it is very much French literature that has influenced [4m[34m{his}[0m own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse [4m[34m{him}[0m of blind worship of Western models . 
(11) [33m{Sartre}[0m is a big man in [4m[34m{Mr. Xingjian 's}[0m life , is n't [33m{he}[0m ? 
(12) [4m[32m{I}[0m would say so that [33m{Sartre}[0m has been a quite a big influence . 
(13) [4m[32m{I}[0m think the other influences would be [4m[36m{Samuel Beckett , the Irish and French language writer , Unesco}[0m . 
(14) [4m[33m{These}[0m are models and , of course , [4m[33m{all of these writers}[0m are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century . 
(15) Well , this is very interesting because [4m[34m{Mr. Gao}[0m left [3m[33m{China}[0m before [4m[35m{Tianenmen}[0m . 
(16) [4m[34m{He}[0m wrote a play , in particular about [4m[35m{the events there}[0m . 
(17) Would [4m[32m{you}[0m say that [4m[34m{his}[0m influences may be more French literary then [3m[35m{they}[0m were [4m[34m{his}[0m own immediate life experience ? 
(18) [4m[32m{I}[0m would say both , in fact , because [1m[31m{the first play that he wrote that made him famous}[0m was a play that dates from 1981 , which was actually called ` Bus Stop ' , which many people said or had [32m{resonances from Beckett 's play ` Waiting for Godot '}[0m and [1m[31m{it}[0m concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came . 
(19) So , we can see immediately that [32m{the resonances with the play of Beckett}[0m , but [4m[34m{Gao Xingjian}[0m really before [34m{1989}[0m felt , that [4m[34m{he}[0m was unable to write and to have [4m[34m{his}[0m plays produced , as [4m[34m{he}[0m would wish , and so left [3m[33m{China}[0m couple of years before [4m[35m{the incident at Tiananmen in 1989}[0m . 
(20) [4m[32m{I}[0m think [4m[31m{it}[0m is a great day for modern Chinese literature and [4m[31m{it}[0m is a day that has been awaited for the past 60 to 70 years . 
(21) [4m[32m{Gregory Lee}[0m is a professor of [35m{Chinese}[0m and Chinese literature at [36m{the University of Lyons , France}[0m . 
(22) [4m[32m{He}[0m spoke to [1m[32m{us}[0m from [4m[32m{his}[0m home in Provence . 
(23) [4m[32m{Professor}[0m , thank [4m[32m{you}[0m very much for speaking with [1m[32m{us}[0m . 
(24) Not at all . 
(25) Thank [31m{you}[0m very much .
