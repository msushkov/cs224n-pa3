(0) There was , of course , a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over the weekend of this trial going on in the courtroom in [4m[32m{Florida}[0m , and , of course , among [3m[33m{the teams of lawyers on the Bush side}[0m , [1m[35m{one of the leaders , Ben Ginsberg , one of the lawyers who argued the case in Leon County Circuit Court}[0m . 
(1) [1m[35m{He}[0m 's with [34m{us}[0m [3m[35m{tonight}[0m , victorious in Tallahassee , [4m[32m{Florida}[0m , and [1m[35m{Ben}[0m , whatever the outcome [3m[34m{today}[0m , and [1m[35m{you}[0m were on the upside , [1m[35m{you}[0m are forced now to go along with [3m[32m{the appeals process}[0m as is the right of [4m[36m{the Gore team}[0m . 
(2) What is [1m[35m{your}[0m reaction to the work [3m[32m{that}[0m will cause ? 
(3) Well , [1m[35m{I}[0m mean , [3m[33m{we}[0m 're certainly prepared to brief all the issues . 
(4) [1m[35m{I}[0m think that the circuit court judge , Judge Sauls gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of [4m[32m{Florida}[0m law . 
(5) Well , let [34m{'s}[0m talk about [1m[35m{your}[0m statement earlier today that [36m{the Vice President}[0m -- [3m[31m{I}[0m guess [1m[35m{you}[0m were asked should [36m{the Vice President}[0m [1m[33m{concede}[0m , and [1m[35m{you}[0m answered , [36m{the Vice President}[0m should do what 's best for the United States . 
(6) Is [1m[33m{that}[0m what [1m[35m{you}[0m 're trying to say ? 
(7) Well , sure . 
(8) [1m[35m{I}[0m mean , [1m[35m{I}[0m think that [33m{all the people involved in this unique situation , the first time a presidential election in our history has been contested}[0m , [3m[31m{Brian}[0m , need to do the right thing , and [1m[35m{I}[0m 'm sure do the right thing , as [33m{they}[0m see fit . 
(9) Do [1m[35m{you}[0m think [31m{the judge there}[0m , in addition to just giving out [31m{his}[0m ruling at the end of the court session [3m[34m{today}[0m , [31m{he}[0m went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why [31m{he}[0m turned down the [36m{Gore}[0m case . 
(10) Do [1m[35m{you}[0m think [31m{his}[0m method there was to try to make [4m[34m{this}[0m more or less appeal proof ? 
(11) Well , [1m[35m{I}[0m think what [31m{he}[0m did was addressed [4m[33m{the situation as it exists in Florida}[0m and addressed the contingencies that were raised in the voluminous briefs that [31m{he}[0m had , not only from the two party candidates involved , but also of the interveners who were in [4m[35m{the case}[0m . 
(12) As [1m[35m{you}[0m know , the Democratic line throughout is they wo n't be happy until every vote is counted , and [34m{we}[0m could n't help but notice , should [34m{we}[0m call it a rhetorical device [1m[35m{you}[0m used when talking to reporters this afternoon . 
(13) Pause and listen along with [34m{us}[0m to the following piece of videotape . 
(14) [3m[36m{Those ballots}[0m have been counted not once on [32m{election night}[0m but twice in the recount and how many did you say there were ? 
(15) [35m{10,750 --}[0m 
(16) If you [4m[31m{know}[0m [35m{the exact number}[0m , does n't [4m[31m{that}[0m mean [3m[36m{they}[0m 've been counted ? 
(17) So [3m[31m{I}[0m do n't suppose that was any accident on [1m[35m{your}[0m part ? 
(18) Well , they have been making [1m[31m{this point}[0m throughout [1m[36m{these proceedings}[0m that [3m[36m{these ballots}[0m have never been counted , and [1m[31m{that}[0m is factually not true . 
(19) [3m[36m{They}[0m have been counted on [32m{election night}[0m -- [3m[36m{they}[0m 've been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not the case that [3m[36m{those ballots}[0m have failed to be counted by anyone . 
(20) [1m[35m{Ben}[0m , for better or worse , [3m[33m{you}[0m are forced now to follow [4m[36m{the Gore team}[0m as [4m[36m{they}[0m take [3m[33m{you}[0m on a kind of trail of appeal here . 
(21) If [1m[35m{you}[0m were asked to predict whether [1m[36m{this}[0m stops at the [4m[32m{Florida}[0m or U.S. Supreme Court , what would [1m[35m{your}[0m prediction be ? 
(22) [1m[35m{I}[0m think it 's one of those situations where [1m[35m{I}[0m would have predicted all , [3m[31m{Brian}[0m . 
(23) [1m[35m{I}[0m think that the decisions are not [3m[33m{ours}[0m to make . 
(24) [3m[33m{We}[0m 'll be involved in [1m[34m{all the legal processes}[0m obviously as long as [4m[36m{the Gore campaign}[0m keeps [1m[34m{them}[0m up , no matter how long that takes . 
(25) [1m[35m{Ben Ginsberg , attorney for the Bush team , victorious today in Tallahassee .}[0m 
(26) Thank [1m[35m{you}[0m very much , after [3m[34m{a long day}[0m , for being with [34m{us}[0m [3m[35m{tonight}[0m . 
(27) Thanks , [3m[31m{Brian}[0m .
