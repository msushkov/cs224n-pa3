(0) [3m[32m{This}[0m is the World , I am Lisa Mullins . 
(1) There are mounting allegations of police and military brutality in [4m[34m{Zimbabwe}[0m . 
(2) But [4m[35m{President Robert Mugabe}[0m has deployed troops to quell rioting over the rising price of food . 
(3) There are sharp increases here just as [4m[34m{Zimbabwe}[0m has slumped into [4m[34m{its}[0m worst economic crisis since becoming independent in 1980 . 
(4) In three days of unrest Army helicopters have dropped teargas in poor suburbs of [3m[34m{the capital Harare}[0m , but [1m[32m{many of those protesting}[0m say [1m[32m{they}[0m wo n't stop until [4m[35m{Mugabe , the man they blame for the country 's economic problems ,}[0m surrenders the presidency . 
(5) From [3m[34m{Harare}[0m [31m{the BBC 's Grant Ferrett}[0m reports . 
(6) Protestors in one of [3m[34m{Harare 's}[0m poor southern townships run for cover as riot police fire teargas from the top of an armored vehicle . 
(7) Such confrontations have been taking place all over the south of [3m[34m{the capital}[0m for several days . 
(8) The aim is twofold , to demand a halt to the rising prices of basics such as food , fuel and transport , as well as the resignation of [4m[35m{President Mugabe}[0m . 
(9) [32m{People}[0m are demonstrating for the price increase fuel and everything . 
(10) [32m{They}[0m are trying to stay away . 
(11) [32m{They}[0m do n't want to go to work . 
(12) [32m{They}[0m want to stay away . 
(13) So what happened here , can you tell [31m{me}[0m ? 
(14) [3m[36m{We}[0m set [35m{a barricade , not for our people but for the police}[0m . 
(15) [3m[36m{We}[0m do n't want [4m[32m{them}[0m . 
(16) [3m[36m{We}[0m want [4m[32m{them}[0m to go . 
(17) And what have [4m[32m{the police}[0m done ? 
(18) [4m[32m{They}[0m are rounding up [3m[33m{people to clear our barricade}[0m , forcing [3m[33m{them}[0m , beating [3m[33m{them}[0m , throwing teargas canisters into school children , but the war here has just started . 
(19) Nearly four months after [4m[34m{Zimbabwe 's}[0m bloodiest parliamentary elections , [1m[31m{the economy}[0m has gone from bad to worse . 
(20) [4m[35m{President Mugabe 's}[0m vitriolic attacks on the west combined with continuing lawlessness , particularly on white owned commercial farms have driven away donors , investors and tourists . 
(21) [4m[34m{Zimbabwe}[0m now has [1m[31m{Africa 's fastest shrinking economy}[0m . 
(22) Many of us like to characterize [4m[34m{Zimbabwe 's}[0m crisis as an economic crisis but [4m[36m{it}[0m is wider and deeper than economy . 
(23) [4m[33m{Simba Makoni}[0m looks and sounds like an opposition politician . 
(24) In fact , [4m[33m{he}[0m is the recently appointed finance minister . 
(25) You can see the price of bread go up , you can see your bus fares go up , you can see companies closing down or working short weeks and that sort of thing , but you can also read [4m[34m{Zimbabwe 's}[0m crisis in the number of destitute people on the streets , in the number of crimes being committed . 
(26) 245 ! 
(27) 245 ! 
(28) [4m[34m{Zimbabwe}[0m earns the bulk of [4m[34m{its}[0m hard currency here on the tobacco auction floors . 
(29) [3m[31m{This year 's}[0m crop is down because of the continuing occupation of white owned farms . 
(30) When the selling season ends next month , [33m{foreign exchange reserves , hardly estimated to cover just a few days of imports}[0m , are likely to completely dry up . 
(31) Without [33m{them}[0m , paying for central imports such as fuel and electricity will become even more difficult . 
(32) What we have right now is [4m[31m{a political crisis}[0m and until [4m[31m{that political crisis}[0m is resolved , there is no way [1m[31m{the economy}[0m is going to improve . 
(33) The sentiments of economist Howard Setoli are widely shared . 
(34) With eighteen months to go until scheduled presidential elections , [4m[34m{Zimbabwe}[0m is headed for complete economic ruin . 
(35) If [3m[35m{government}[0m continues on [3m[35m{its}[0m current path , [1m[31m{the economy}[0m will continue to contract . 
(36) [3m[31m{This year}[0m [1m[31m{it}[0m was expected to contract by 8 % . 
(37) Next year we [36m{see}[0m a further contraction of 12 % . 
(38) So we are talking of massive unemployment , severe foreign exchange shortage . 
(39) [36m{It}[0m is an alarming prediction . 
(40) For [34m{those taking part in the protests on the streets}[0m , after two decades in office [34m{they}[0m want [4m[35m{President Mugabe}[0m to go now . 
(41) We want a new President . 
(42) The situation is like Yugoslavia now . 
(43) We do n't want [4m[35m{Mugabe}[0m . 
(44) No more . 
(45) For [3m[32m{The World}[0m , [31m{I}[0m am Grant Ferrett , in [3m[34m{Harare}[0m .
