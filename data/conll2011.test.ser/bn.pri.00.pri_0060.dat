(0) Five years ago today , [31m{the agreement ending the war in Bosnia}[0m was initialed in [36m{Dayton Ohio}[0m . 
(1) [1m[35m{Western leaders}[0m were n't wild about relying on [33m{Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic}[0m to help implement [31m{the accord}[0m , but [1m[35m{they}[0m felt [1m[35m{they}[0m had no choice . 
(2) Five years later , [4m[32m{the West and the United States in particular}[0m are n't counting on [33m{the deposed leader}[0m for anything . 
(3) [4m[32m{They}[0m want to see [33m{his}[0m successor Vojislav Kostinica extradite [33m{Milosevic}[0m through [4m[33m{the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague}[0m , but not only is [33m{Milosevic}[0m still living comfortable in [4m[35m{Belgrade}[0m , last night [33m{he}[0m made [33m{his}[0m first TV appearance in six weeks , giving a pep talk to [33m{his}[0m supporters . 
(4) [32m{The World 's}[0m Jeb Sharp reports on the still unresolved fate of [33m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m . 
(5) [33m{He}[0m 's kept [3m[32m{Western diplomats}[0m spinning in circles for more than a decade . 
(6) Five years ago [3m[32m{they}[0m were negotiating with [33m{Milosevic}[0m at [36m{Dayton}[0m to stop [3m[31m{the war in Bosnia}[0m . 
(7) Two years ago [3m[32m{they}[0m were still shuttling back and forth to [4m[35m{Belgrade}[0m in an effort to solve the Kosovo crisis . 
(8) By March of last year [3m[32m{they}[0m had given up talking and [4m[31m{Nato}[0m had started bombing instead . 
(9) When [33m{Milosevic}[0m was indited on war crimes charges soon after , US and other Western officials began [36m{calling}[0m for [33m{his}[0m arrest and transfer to [3m[33m{The Hague}[0m , but now that [4m[33m{a delicate transition}[0m is underway in [4m[36m{Serbia}[0m , [36m{those calls}[0m have grown quieter , according to [3m[35m{Gary Bass , the author of the new book about war crimes trials , ` Stay , the Hand of Vengeance '}[0m . 
(10) Even Madeleine Albright , who is with the President who is usually most decipherous about the importance of prosecuting war criminals , has in fact said that our first priority is making sure that [1m[32m{Vojislov Kostunica}[0m can consolidate [1m[32m{his}[0m democratic government and make [4m[33m{that transition}[0m , and the issue of punishing war criminals sort of takes a back seat . 
(11) [3m[35m{Bass}[0m says US diplomats do n't want to risk destabilizing [4m[36m{Serbia 's}[0m fragile political situation by pushing too hard for war crimes trials . 
(12) After all [3m[35m{Bass}[0m points out , outside pressure has backfired in the past . 
(13) In Germany after [1m[31m{World War I}[0m and in the Ottoman Empire also after [1m[31m{World War I}[0m , the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials , and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash . 
(14) A nationalist backlash in [4m[36m{Serbia}[0m right now could [32m{play}[0m into [33m{Milosevic 's}[0m hands , especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for next month . 
(15) [32m{That}[0m 's one reason Western governments are not demanding [33m{his}[0m immediate arrest , but critics of this approach say letting [33m{Milosevic}[0m stay in [4m[35m{Belgrade}[0m could be equally destabilizing . 
(16) [34m{Eva Barnetts , professor of history at Yale ,}[0m says [1m[32m{President Kostunica}[0m should cooperate immediately with [4m[33m{the Hague Tribunal}[0m . 
(17) [4m[33m{This particular UN institution}[0m has in [4m[33m{its}[0m power really to give instant legitimacy to [1m[32m{Kostunica}[0m but of course at [1m[33m{a price}[0m . 
(18) [1m[33m{It}[0m means that the government of [35m{Yugoslavia}[0m has to become very serious about dealing with the indited war criminals , beginning with [33m{Slobodan Milosevic himself}[0m . 
(19) But [33m{even officials at The Hague}[0m say [33m{they}[0m are willing to be patient with [1m[32m{the new Yugoslav President}[0m . 
(20) [4m[33m{Tribunal}[0m spokesman Jim Landel says it helps that [1m[32m{Kostunica 's}[0m people who initially refused to even entertain the idea of arresting [33m{Milosevic}[0m , may be starting to cooperate with [4m[33m{the Tribunal}[0m . 
(21) [3m[34m{They}[0m have already [4m[31m{indicated}[0m that [3m[34m{they}[0m are willing to allow the reopening of the prosecutor 's liaison office in [4m[35m{Belgrade}[0m , and [4m[31m{that}[0m 's certainly a welcome first step . 
(22) However , [4m[31m{it}[0m is only a first step . 
(23) [4m[33m{The Tribunal 's}[0m chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte has applied for a Yugoslav visa and plans to visit [4m[35m{Belgrade}[0m soon . 
(24) [1m[36m{Delponte 's}[0m spokeswoman says [1m[36m{the prosecutor}[0m has much to discuss with [1m[32m{Kostunica}[0m , not least how to [4m[34m{arrest}[0m all the indited war crimes suspects now in [4m[36m{Serbia}[0m . 
(25) [4m[34m{That}[0m wo n't be easy . 
(26) Even in [4m[32m{Bosnia where Nato is in charge}[0m , troops have failed to [4m[35m{capture}[0m [4m[36m{Bosnian - Serb leader Radavan Karadzic , indited on genocide charges in connection with the 1995 massacre at Shrabanitca}[0m . 
(27) [34m{Yale}[0m history professor Eva Barnett says the excuses for not arresting [4m[36m{Karadzic}[0m are not persuasive . 
(28) [1m[31m{The claim}[0m is that [4m[35m{this}[0m would engender tremendously destabilizing consequences that in any event [4m[35m{it}[0m might be a very , very bloody affair and so on . 
(29) [1m[31m{This}[0m does not seem terribly compelling to [34m{me}[0m . 
(30) [34m{I}[0m think that [4m[35m{it}[0m has to be [3m[36m{tried}[0m and of course there is always [31m{a danger that somebody might get hurt in this}[0m , but [31m{that}[0m is a danger that every attempt at remedying criminal activity has to face . 
(31) [4m[33m{Hague}[0m prosecutor Carla Del Ponte is prepared to discuss arrest strategies with [1m[32m{Kostunica}[0m including the use of foreign troops . 
(32) It 's difficult to know how [1m[32m{he}[0m would react . 
(33) [1m[32m{Kostunica}[0m has questioned the legality of [4m[33m{the Hague Tribunal}[0m , and talked of trying [33m{Milosevic}[0m in [35m{Yugoslavia}[0m . 
(34) Still , [1m[32m{Kostunica 's}[0m grace period wo n't last forever . 
(35) When [1m[34m{the US Congress}[0m approved [4m[34m{one hundred million dollars in aid to Serbia}[0m last month , [1m[34m{it}[0m stipulated [4m[34m{the aid}[0m would stop flowing if [4m[36m{Belgrade}[0m has n't cooperated with [4m[33m{the tribunal}[0m by March 31st . 
(36) For [32m{The World}[0m , [35m{I}[0m am Jeb Sharp .
