(0) [31m{The Internal Revenue Service}[0m has [4m[33m{threatened}[0m criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report [36m{detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ 10,000 in cash}[0m . 
(1) [4m[33m{The warnings , issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week ,}[0m have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar , who claim [36m{the information}[0m is protected by [1m[36m{attorney - client privilege}[0m . 
(2) [4m[33m{The IRS warnings}[0m stem from [36m{a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $ 10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300}[0m . 
(3) [35m{The form}[0m asks for such details as [32m{the client 's}[0m name , Social Security number , passport number and details about the services provided for [4m[31m{the payment}[0m . 
(4) [1m[35m{Failure to complete the form}[0m had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November , when [33m{Congress}[0m determined that [1m[35m{the crime}[0m was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison . 
(5) [36m{Attorneys}[0m have argued since [3m[32m{1985 , when the law took effect}[0m , that [36m{they}[0m can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known . 
(6) Many attorneys have returned [1m[36m{incomplete forms}[0m to [31m{the IRS}[0m in recent years , citing [1m[36m{attorney - client privilege}[0m . 
(7) Until last week , [31m{the IRS}[0m rarely acted on [1m[36m{the incomplete forms}[0m . 
(8) `` [35m{This form}[0m forces [3m[31m{a lawyer}[0m to become , in effect , a witness against [3m[31m{his}[0m client , '' said [35m{Neal R. Sonnett , president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers}[0m . 
(9) `` [31m{The IRS}[0m is asking lawyers to red - flag a criminal problem to [1m[36m{the government}[0m , '' added [35m{Mr. Sonnett , a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer - generated IRS forms sent by certified mail}[0m . 
(10) [35m{Mr. Sonnett}[0m said that clients who pay cash may include [3m[36m{alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts}[0m . 
(11) [3m[36m{These individuals}[0m may not necessarily be under investigation when [3m[36m{they}[0m hire lawyers . 
(12) [35m{Mr. Sonnett}[0m said there also may be other circumstances under which [4m[32m{individuals}[0m would n't want [1m[36m{the government}[0m to know [4m[32m{they}[0m had retained criminal defense lawyers . 
(13) Filling out detailed forms about [4m[32m{these individuals}[0m would tip [31m{the IRS}[0m off and spark action against [4m[32m{the clients}[0m , [35m{he}[0m said . 
(14) [3m[35m{The defense lawyers ' group}[0m formed a task force this week , chaired by [31m{New York}[0m attorney Gerald Lefcourt , to deal with [1m[31m{the matter}[0m . 
(15) [34m{The American Bar Association 's}[0m House of Delegates passed a resolution in [3m[32m{1985}[0m condemning [4m[36m{the IRS reporting requirement}[0m . 
(16) [32m{Michael Ross , a New York lawyer who heads the ABA 's grand jury committee ,}[0m said that lawyers are prohibited by [34m{the ABA 's}[0m code of ethics from [3m[36m{disclosing}[0m information about [1m[35m{a client}[0m except where a court orders [3m[36m{it}[0m or to prevent [1m[35m{the client}[0m from committing a criminal act that could result in death . 
(17) [32m{Mr. Ross}[0m said [32m{he}[0m [1m[33m{met}[0m with officials of [31m{the IRS}[0m and [1m[32m{the Justice Department , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers ,}[0m to discuss [1m[31m{the issue}[0m last May . 
(18) At [1m[33m{that meeting}[0m , [32m{he}[0m said , [1m[32m{the Justice Department}[0m assured [32m{him}[0m that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice . 
(19) [32m{Mr. Ross}[0m said [31m{IRS}[0m officials opposed [1m[32m{the Justice Department 's}[0m moderate stance on [1m[31m{the matter}[0m . 
(20) But in [34m{the letters sent in recent days}[0m , Christopher J. Lezovich of the [31m{IRS}[0m computing center in Detroit , told attorneys that `` failing to voluntarily submit [36m{the requested information}[0m could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . '' 
(21) In some cases , [31m{the IRS}[0m asked for information dating back to forms [31m{it}[0m received in [3m[32m{1985}[0m . 
(22) [3m[35m{A spokesman for the IRS}[0m confirmed that `` there has been [34m{correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s}[0m , '' but [3m[35m{he}[0m declined to say why [34m{the letters}[0m were sent to lawyers now . 
(23) Individuals familiar with [1m[32m{the Justice Department 's}[0m policy said that [1m[32m{Justice}[0m officials had n't any knowledge of [31m{the IRS 's}[0m actions in [3m[31m{the last week}[0m . 
(24) [4m[33m{Lawyers}[0m worry that if [4m[33m{they}[0m provide [36m{information about clients}[0m , [36m{that data}[0m could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors . 
(25) [3m[34m{Prosecutors}[0m need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business . 
(26) But [3m[34m{they}[0m have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used [36m{the information}[0m to help develop criminal cases . 
(27) Some criminal lawyers speculated that [31m{the IRS}[0m was sending [34m{the letters}[0m to test [1m[31m{the issue}[0m . 
(28) In a number of recent cases , federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential . 
(29) THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes [4m[34m{a victim}[0m . 
(30) Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not [4m[34m{federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento , Calif}[0m . 
(31) On Tuesday , [4m[34m{the judge}[0m called a news conference to say [4m[34m{he}[0m was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join [3m[34m{a San Francisco law firm}[0m . 
(32) The reason : the refusal of [33m{Congress}[0m to give federal judges a raise . 
(33) `` [3m[33m{A couple of my law clerks}[0m were going to pass [4m[34m{me}[0m in three or four years , and [4m[34m{I}[0m was afraid [4m[34m{I}[0m was going to have to ask [3m[33m{them}[0m for a loan , '' [4m[34m{the judge}[0m quipped in an interview . 
(34) [32m{Federal judges}[0m make $ 89,500 annually ; in February , [33m{Congress}[0m rejected a bill that would have increased [32m{their}[0m pay by 50 % . 
(35) [33m{Judge Ramirez , 44 ,}[0m said it is unjust for [3m[31m{judges}[0m to make what [3m[31m{they}[0m do . 
(36) `` [3m[35m{Judges}[0m are not getting what [3m[35m{they}[0m deserve . 
(37) You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an eye . 
(38) When you become a federal judge , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . '' 
(39) At [33m{his}[0m new job , as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of [3m[34m{Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe}[0m , [33m{he}[0m will make out much better . 
(40) [33m{The judge}[0m declined to discuss [33m{his}[0m salary in detail , but said : `` [33m{I}[0m 'm going to be a high - priced lawyer . '' 
(41) [35m{DOONESBURY CREATOR'S}[0m UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter . 
(42) [35m{Cartoonist Garry Trudeau}[0m is suing [4m[32m{the Writers Guild of America East}[0m for [3m[33m{$ 11 million}[0m , alleging [4m[32m{it}[0m mounted a `` campaign to [1m[31m{harass}[0m and punish '' [35m{him}[0m for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line . 
(43) [4m[34m{The dispute}[0m involves [1m[33m{Darkhorse Productions Inc. , a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner}[0m . 
(44) [35m{Mr. Trudeau , a Writers Guild member ,}[0m also was employed as a writer for [1m[33m{Darkhorse , which was covered by a guild collective - bargaining agreement}[0m . 
(45) [4m[32m{The guild}[0m began [1m[33m{a strike against the TV and movie industry}[0m in March 1988 . 
(46) In [35m{his}[0m lawsuit , [35m{Mr. Trudeau}[0m says [1m[33m{the strike}[0m illegally included [1m[33m{Darkhorse}[0m , and [35m{the cartoonist}[0m refused to honor the strike against [1m[33m{the company}[0m . 
(47) [4m[31m{A spokesman for the guild}[0m said [4m[32m{the union 's}[0m lawyers are reviewing [4m[33m{the suit}[0m . 
(48) [4m[31m{He}[0m said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against [35m{Mr. Trudeau}[0m . 
(49) [35m{Mr. Trudeau 's}[0m attorney , Norman K. Samnick , said [1m[31m{the harassment}[0m consists mainly of [4m[32m{the guild 's}[0m year - long threats of [1m[34m{disciplinary action}[0m . 
(50) [4m[32m{Mr. Samnick}[0m said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in [31m{New York}[0m . 
(51) [4m[32m{Mr. Samnick , who will go before the disciplinary panel ,}[0m said the proceedings are unfair and that [1m[34m{any punishment from the guild}[0m would be unjustified . 
(52) In addition to [3m[33m{the damages}[0m , [4m[33m{the suit}[0m seeks a court order preventing [4m[32m{the guild}[0m from punishing or retaliating against [35m{Mr. Trudeau}[0m . 
(53) [1m[34m{ABORTION RULING}[0m [3m[33m{UPHELD}[0m : 
(54) [3m[32m{A federal appeals court}[0m [3m[33m{upheld}[0m [1m[34m{a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family - planning programs that include abortion - related services}[0m . 
(55) [4m[31m{A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988}[0m prohibits the use of [33m{so - called Title X funds}[0m for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion , such as abortion counseling and referrals . 
(56) [4m[31m{The rule}[0m also prohibits funding for activities that `` encourage , promote or advocate abortion . '' 
(57) [33m{Title X funds}[0m are the single largest source of federal funding for family - planning services , according to the opinion by [3m[32m{the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York}[0m . 
(58) [3m[32m{The panel}[0m ruled that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women . 
(59) [4m[35m{INQUIRY}[0m CLEARS [3m[34m{TEXAS}[0m JUDGE of [31m{bias}[0m in comments on [1m[32m{homosexual murder victims}[0m . 
(60) [4m[36m{Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton}[0m had sparked calls for [4m[35m{a judicial inquiry}[0m with [4m[36m{his}[0m remarks to the press last December , two weeks after sentencing an 18 - year - old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing [1m[32m{two homosexual men}[0m in a city park . 
(61) [4m[36m{The judge}[0m was quoted as referring to [1m[32m{the victims}[0m as `` queers '' and saying [1m[32m{they}[0m would n't have been killed `` if [1m[32m{they}[0m had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys . '' 
(62) But [3m[36m{Robert R. Murray , a special master appointed by the Texas Supreme Court ,}[0m said [4m[36m{Judge Hampton}[0m did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although [4m[36m{he}[0m did violate [3m[34m{the state 's}[0m judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case . 
(63) Observing that [4m[35m{the judge}[0m `` has never exhibited any [31m{bias}[0m or prejudice , '' [3m[36m{Mr. Murray}[0m concluded that [4m[35m{he}[0m `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim . 
(64) [3m[36m{Mr. Murray}[0m also said [4m[36m{Judge Hampton 's}[0m comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice . 
(65) The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct , which is empowered to impose sanctions . 
(66) [4m[36m{GAF}[0m TRIAL goes to [1m[31m{round three}[0m . 
(67) Attorneys in [1m[31m{the third stock - manipulation trial of GAF Corp.}[0m began opening arguments yesterday in the [1m[35m{Manhattan}[0m courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe . 
(68) In an eight - count indictment , [1m[36m{the government}[0m has charged [4m[36m{GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , specialty chemical maker ,}[0m and its Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin with attempting to manipulate [4m[34m{the common stock of Union Carbide Corp.}[0m in advance of [3m[32m{GAF 's}[0m planned sale of a large block of [4m[34m{the stock}[0m in November 1986 . 
(69) The first two [3m[32m{GAF}[0m trials ended in mistrials earlier this year . 
(70) [1m[31m{This trial}[0m is expected to last five weeks . 
(71) SWITCHING TO THE DEFENSE : 
(72) A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran / Contra affair joined [1m[32m{the Chicago firm of Mayer , Brown & Platt}[0m . 
(73) [4m[35m{Michael R. Bromwich , a member since January 1987 of the three - lawyer trial team in the prosecution of Oliver North ,}[0m became a partner in the Washington , D.C. , office of [1m[32m{the 520 - lawyer firm}[0m . 
(74) [4m[35m{He}[0m will specialize in white - collar criminal defense work . 
(75) [4m[35m{Mr. Bromwich , 35 ,}[0m also has served as deputy chief and chief of the narcotics unit for the U.S. attorney 's office for the Southern District of [31m{New York}[0m , based in [1m[35m{Manhattan}[0m .
