(0) [1m[34m{Walter Sisulu}[0m and [1m[36m{the African National Congress}[0m came [4m[33m{home}[0m [32m{yesterday}[0m . 
(1) After 26 years in prison , [1m[34m{Mr. Sisulu , the 77 - year - old former secretary - general of the liberation movement ,}[0m was dropped off at [1m[34m{his}[0m house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up . 
(2) At the same time , [1m[32m{six ANC colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment ,}[0m were reunited with [1m[32m{their}[0m families at various places around [3m[31m{the country}[0m . 
(3) And as [4m[32m{the graying men}[0m returned to [4m[32m{their}[0m homes , [1m[36m{the ANC , outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government ,}[0m defiantly returned to the streets of [3m[33m{the country 's black townships}[0m . 
(4) A huge [1m[36m{ANC}[0m flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at [1m[34m{Mr. Sisulu 's}[0m modest house , while on the street out front , [35m{boys}[0m displayed the [1m[36m{ANC}[0m colors on [35m{their}[0m shirts , caps and scarves . 
(5) At the small four - room home of Elias Motsoaledi , a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in [4m[35m{the group 's armed wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe}[0m , [31m{well - wishers}[0m stuck little [1m[36m{ANC}[0m flags in [31m{their}[0m hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in [1m[36m{ANC}[0m ribbons . 
(6) `` [1m[34m{I}[0m am happy to see the spirit of the people , '' said [1m[34m{Mr. Sisulu}[0m , looking dapper in a new gray suit . 
(7) As the crowd outside [1m[34m{his}[0m home shouted `` [1m[36m{ANC}[0m , [1m[36m{ANC}[0m , '' [1m[34m{the old man}[0m shot [1m[34m{his}[0m fists into the air . 
(8) `` [1m[34m{I}[0m 'm inspired by the mood of the people . '' 
(9) Under the laws of [3m[31m{the land}[0m , [1m[36m{the ANC}[0m remains an illegal organization , and [1m[36m{its}[0m headquarters are still in [1m[31m{Lusaka , Zambia}[0m . 
(10) But [34m{the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC ,}[0m is a de facto unbanning of [4m[34m{the movement}[0m and the rebirth of [4m[34m{its}[0m internal wing . 
(11) `` [3m[31m{The government}[0m can never put [1m[36m{the ANC}[0m back into the bottle again , '' said Cassim Saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome [1m[34m{Mr. Sisulu}[0m . 
(12) `` Things have gone too far for [3m[31m{the government}[0m to stop [1m[36m{them}[0m now . 
(13) There 's no turning back . '' 
(14) There was certainly no stopping the tide of [1m[36m{ANC}[0m emotion last night , when hundreds of people jammed into [1m[33m{the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto}[0m for what became [33m{the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years}[0m . 
(15) Deafening chants of `` [1m[36m{ANC}[0m '' and `` [4m[35m{Umkhonto we Sizwe}[0m '' shook [1m[33m{the church}[0m as [4m[32m{the seven aging men}[0m vowed that [1m[36m{the ANC}[0m would continue [1m[36m{its}[0m fight against [3m[31m{the government}[0m and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle . 
(16) And [4m[32m{they}[0m called on [3m[31m{the government}[0m to release [3m[34m{Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison}[0m . 
(17) Without [3m[34m{him}[0m , said [1m[34m{Mr. Sisulu}[0m , [34m{the freeing of the others}[0m `` is only a half - measure . '' 
(18) [1m[35m{President F.W. de Klerk}[0m released [4m[32m{the ANC men}[0m -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of [1m[35m{his}[0m efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which [1m[35m{his}[0m government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government . 
(19) But [3m[31m{Pretoria}[0m may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in [3m[31m{this racially divided country}[0m . 
(20) As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . 
(21) As the days go by , [3m[31m{the South African government}[0m will be ever more hard pressed to justify [3m[35m{the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency}[0m . 
(22) If [3m[31m{it}[0m does n't yield on [3m[35m{these matters}[0m , and eventually begin talking directly to [1m[36m{the ANC}[0m , the expectations and promise raised by [32m{yesterday}[0m 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . 
(23) If [3m[31m{it}[0m does , [4m[31m{the large number of right - wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority ,}[0m will step up [4m[31m{their}[0m agitation and threats to take matters into [4m[31m{their}[0m own hands . 
(24) [4m[32m{The newly released ANC leaders}[0m also will be under enormous pressure . 
(25) [3m[31m{The government}[0m is watching closely to see if [4m[32m{their}[0m presence in [3m[33m{the townships}[0m leads to [36m{increased anti-government protests and violence}[0m ; if [3m[32m{it}[0m does , [3m[31m{Pretoria}[0m will use [36m{this}[0m as a reason to keep [3m[34m{Mr. Mandela}[0m behind bars . 
(26) [3m[31m{Pretoria}[0m has n't forgotten why [4m[32m{they}[0m were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow [3m[31m{the government}[0m . 
(27) In addition , [3m[31m{the government}[0m is figuring that [34m{the releases}[0m could create a split between the internal and external wings of [1m[36m{the ANC}[0m and between [4m[32m{the newly freed leaders}[0m and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside [3m[31m{the country}[0m during [4m[32m{their}[0m imprisonment . 
(28) In order to head off any divisions , [3m[34m{Mr. Mandela}[0m , in a meeting with [3m[34m{his}[0m colleagues before [4m[32m{they}[0m were released , instructed [4m[32m{them}[0m to report to [1m[33m{the ANC headquarters in Lusaka}[0m as soon as possible . 
(29) [4m[32m{The men}[0m also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between [4m[32m{themselves}[0m and the [3m[31m{country}[0m 's many militant black youths , the so - called young lions who are anxious to see [4m[32m{the old lions}[0m in action . 
(30) Says Peter Mokaba , president of [1m[34m{the South African Youth Congress}[0m : `` [1m[34m{We}[0m will be expecting [4m[32m{them}[0m to act like leaders of [1m[36m{the ANC}[0m . '' 
(31) [4m[32m{They}[0m never considered [4m[32m{themselves}[0m to be anything else . 
(32) At [33m{last night 's rally}[0m , [4m[32m{they}[0m called on [4m[32m{their}[0m followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in [3m[36m{their}[0m opposition to apartheid . 
(33) `` [4m[35m{We}[0m emphasize discipline because [4m[35m{we}[0m know that [3m[31m{the government}[0m is very , very sensitive , '' said Andrew Mlangeni , another early [4m[35m{Umkhonto}[0m leader who is now 63 . 
(34) `` [4m[35m{We}[0m want to see [3m[34m{Nelson Mandela}[0m and all our comrades out of prison , and if [4m[35m{we}[0m are n't disciplined [4m[35m{we}[0m may not see [4m[36m{them}[0m here with [4m[35m{us}[0m .
