(0) This is [1m[33m{the World}[0m [1m[34m{I}[0m am Lisa Mullins . 
(1) Well [1m[33m{we}[0m ca n't tell you who won Florida , but in a moment [1m[33m{we}[0m will enter the musical question , who let the dogs out ? 
(2) First up [1m[33m{we}[0m have [35m{the answer to our geo quiz today}[0m . 
(3) [1m[33m{We}[0m are looking for [34m{a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea}[0m . 
(4) [34m{The area}[0m is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno , the highest peak of the Apennines . 
(5) [34m{It}[0m also includes [3m[35m{a lot of sheep , good clean - living , healthy sheep}[0m , and [1m[31m{an Italian entrepreneur}[0m has an idea about how to make a little money of [3m[35m{them}[0m . 
(6) [35m{The answer}[0m is Abruzzo . 
(7) [4m[36m{Journalist Carlos Depalazai}[0m was in [31m{Rome , Italy}[0m and [4m[36m{Carlo}[0m how does this [1m[31m{fellow}[0m plan to profit from [3m[35m{the sheep of the Abruzzo}[0m ? 
(8) [1m[31m{He}[0m is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in [4m[34m{the Italy}[0m at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food . 
(9) So [1m[31m{this guy}[0m came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet . 
(10) So you can have access through your computer on your desk . 
(11) Go to [4m[35m{the web site of these guys}[0m and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted . 
(12) So what does it mean to adopt [1m[32m{a sheep}[0m , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of [1m[32m{its}[0m progress on [1m[35m{the farm in Italy}[0m ? 
(13) You are not actually adopting [1m[36m{the sheep}[0m in the sense that you can have [1m[36m{it}[0m with you . 
(14) [3m[32m{It}[0m looks like distant adoption , where you do n't actually have the child in your home . 
(15) You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up . 
(16) [3m[32m{It}[0m works in the same way , so you have access on [4m[35m{the web site of this little farm , in a little village of Abrutzi}[0m and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with [32m{a certain amount of money}[0m the sheep is actually yours . 
(17) All right , so [32m{the amount of money you have mentioned to us}[0m is about 160 US dollars and for [32m{that}[0m you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling . 
(18) You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of the sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door . 
(19) Yeah , [4m[36m{I}[0m mean this is quite funny , but apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange [4m[36m{I}[0m think what is really important is that [3m[32m{it}[0m is a sign of a new concern that is effecting [4m[33m{Italian people}[0m . 
(20) [4m[36m{I}[0m mean [4m[33m{we}[0m are notoriously lover of good food . 
(21) [4m[33m{We}[0m have a generous attitude towards food , and [3m[32m{this}[0m is a new stuff . 
(22) The fact that you really care about [3m[34m{a sheep}[0m in the way [3m[34m{she}[0m is fed , in the way [3m[34m{she}[0m is nurtured , in the way people are looking after [3m[34m{it}[0m , because it 's a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on your table up the end . 
(23) Wait a minute , [4m[36m{you}[0m said that on your table at the end . 
(24) Yeah , at the table if [3m[34m{it}[0m becomes food for instance , which is [33m{an option}[0m . 
(25) You are adopting [3m[34m{the sheep}[0m and whatever happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option [3m[31m{is}[0m you know food for your meal . 
(26) [3m[31m{That}[0m kind of puts a whole new tone to [3m[32m{this thing}[0m . 
(27) [1m[34m{I}[0m mean usually when you think of [3m[33m{this kind of adoption}[0m [3m[33m{that}[0m means saving [4m[32m{an animal}[0m not eventually eating [4m[32m{it}[0m . 
(28) [4m[36m{I}[0m mean [33m{this}[0m [3m[31m{is}[0m an option which is available and [4m[36m{I}[0m think [3m[31m{it}[0m is a sort of provocation . 
(29) You know [3m[36m{Italians}[0m now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like [31m{Rome}[0m , Florence , Naples . 
(30) In the past , [3m[36m{we}[0m were a population of shepherds or farmers . 
(31) [3m[36m{We}[0m had completely different attitude towards nature . 
(32) It seems that [3m[36m{we}[0m are losing something , and [3m[36m{we}[0m need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that [4m[31m{the Environment Minister in Italy}[0m supported the initiative and [4m[31m{he himself}[0m adopted a sheep is significant . 
(33) [4m[31m{He}[0m took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of [3m[36m{Italians}[0m towards nature and farms . 
(34) [4m[36m{Carlo De Blazia , journalist speaking to us from Rome .}[0m 
(35) Thank [4m[36m{you}[0m very much [4m[36m{Carlo}[0m . 
(36) Nice to talk to [4m[36m{you}[0m . 
(37) Thank [1m[34m{you}[0m .
