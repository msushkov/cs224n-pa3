(0) [1m[32m{Common Cause}[0m asked both [3m[35m{the Senate Ethics Committee}[0m and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by [35m{Arizona}[0m businessman Charles Keating to [3m[34m{five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift - industry regulators for him}[0m . 
(1) [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering [4m[35m{lawsuit}[0m accusing [3m[31m{him}[0m of bleeding off assets of [31m{a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association}[0m , and driving [31m{it}[0m into insolvency . 
(2) [31m{Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self - styled citizens lobby --}[0m said [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m already has [34m{conceded}[0m attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. [36m{Dennis DeConcini}[0m of [35m{Arizona}[0m , [3m[36m{Alan Cranston}[0m of [32m{California}[0m , [3m[32m{John Glenn}[0m of [4m[32m{Ohio}[0m and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and [33m{GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona}[0m . 
(3) [31m{Mr. Wertheimer}[0m based [34m{this}[0m on a statement by [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether [3m[31m{my}[0m financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up [3m[31m{my}[0m cause . 
(4) [3m[31m{I}[0m want to say in the most forceful way [3m[31m{I}[0m can : [3m[31m{I}[0m certainly hope so . '' 
(5) In [34m{a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987}[0m , [3m[34m{the five senators}[0m asked [36m{federal regulators}[0m to ease up on [31m{Lincoln}[0m . 
(6) According to [1m[34m{notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting}[0m , [36m{the regulators}[0m said [31m{Lincoln}[0m was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . '' 
(7) [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m had complained that [36m{the regulators}[0m were being too zealous . 
(8) [1m[34m{The notes}[0m show that [36m{Sen. DeConcini}[0m called [3m[33m{the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's}[0m regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that [3m[32m{Sen. Glenn}[0m insisted that [3m[31m{Mr. Keating 's}[0m thrift was `` viable and profitable . '' 
(9) For the next two years , [3m[33m{the Bank Board , which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts ,}[0m failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May [35m{1987}[0m that [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m had caused [31m{Lincoln}[0m to become insolvent . 
(10) [31m{Lincoln}[0m 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy - law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized [31m{the thrift}[0m the next day . 
(11) The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. , successor to [3m[33m{the Bank Board}[0m , filed [4m[35m{suit}[0m against [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m and several others on Sept. 15 . 
(12) [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m has filed [3m[31m{his}[0m own suit , alleging that [3m[31m{his}[0m property was taken illegally . 
(13) The cost to taxpayers of [31m{Lincoln}[0m 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ 2.5 billion . 
(14) Details of [4m[34m{the affair}[0m have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers . 
(15) In the midst of [1m[36m{his}[0m [1m[33m{1988}[0m re-election campaign , [1m[36m{Sen. Riegle , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee ,}[0m [1m[34m{returned}[0m [1m[35m{$ 76,000 in contributions}[0m after a Detroit newspaper said that [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m had gathered [1m[35m{the money}[0m for [1m[36m{him}[0m about two weeks before [34m{the meeting with regulators}[0m . 
(16) [36m{Sen. DeConcini}[0m , after months of fending off intense press criticism , returned $ 48,000 only last month , shortly after the government formally accused [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m of defrauding [31m{Lincoln}[0m . 
(17) In addition , [33m{Sen. McCain}[0m last week disclosed that [33m{he}[0m belatedly had paid $ 13,433 to [1m[31m{American Continental}[0m as reimbursement for [4m[33m{trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to Mr. Keating 's vacation home at Cat Cay , the Bahamas , from 1984 through 1986}[0m . 
(18) [33m{Sen. McCain}[0m said [33m{he}[0m had meant to [1m[33m{pay}[0m for [4m[33m{the trips}[0m at the time but that [1m[33m{the matter}[0m `` fell between the cracks . '' 
(19) [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m , [3m[31m{his}[0m family members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to [33m{Sen. McCain 's}[0m congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts . 
(20) But [33m{Sen. McCain}[0m says [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m broke off their friendship abruptly in [35m{1987}[0m , because [33m{the senator}[0m [1m[32m{refused}[0m to press [3m[31m{the thrift executive 's}[0m case as vigorously as [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m wanted . 
(21) `` [3m[31m{He}[0m became very angry at [1m[32m{that}[0m , left [33m{my}[0m office and told a number of people that [33m{I}[0m was a wimp , '' [33m{Sen. McCain}[0m recalls . 
(22) In [32m{July}[0m , [32m{California}[0m newspapers disclosed that [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m gave [4m[31m{$ 850,000 in corporate funds}[0m to three tax - exempt voter registration organizations in [35m{1987}[0m and [1m[33m{1988}[0m at the behest of [3m[36m{Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically}[0m . '' 
(23) In addition , [3m[36m{Sen. Cranston}[0m received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m , and the [32m{California}[0m Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a [1m[31m{1986}[0m get - out - the - vote drive that benefited the [3m[36m{senator}[0m 's re-election campaign [1m[31m{that year}[0m . 
(24) Also in [32m{July}[0m , [4m[32m{Ohio}[0m newspapers disclosed [4m[36m{$ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn}[0m . 
(25) [4m[36m{That}[0m was in addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by [3m[31m{Mr. Keating}[0m to [3m[32m{the Ohio senator}[0m . 
(26) [31m{Mr. Wertheimer}[0m said [3m[35m{the Senate Ethics Committee}[0m should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright . 
(27) Wilson Abney , staff director of [3m[35m{the ethics panel}[0m , would n't comment . 
(28) [1m[36m{Sen. Riegle}[0m said [1m[36m{he}[0m would cooperate with any inquiry , but that [1m[36m{his}[0m conduct had been `` entirely proper . '' 
(29) [33m{Sen. McCain}[0m said [33m{he}[0m had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of [34m{the meeting}[0m that [34m{it}[0m might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for [33m{him}[0m to seek fair treatment for a constituent . 
(30) [3m[32m{Sen. Glenn}[0m said [3m[32m{he}[0m had already made a complete disclosure of [3m[32m{his}[0m role in [4m[34m{the affair}[0m and `` [3m[32m{I}[0m am completely satisfied to let [4m[34m{this matter}[0m rest in the hands of [3m[35m{the Senate Ethics Committee}[0m . '' 
(31) [36m{Sen. DeConcini}[0m said , `` When all is said and done , [36m{I}[0m expect to be fully exonerated . '' 
(32) [3m[36m{Sen. Cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating ,}[0m portrayed [3m[36m{his}[0m role in [35m{1987}[0m as prodding regulators to act . 
(33) `` Why did n't [3m[33m{the Bank Board}[0m act sooner ? '' [3m[36m{he}[0m said . 
(34) `` That is what [1m[32m{Common Cause}[0m should ask be investigated .
