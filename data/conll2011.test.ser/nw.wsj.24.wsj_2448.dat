(0) When [4m[34m{China}[0m opened [4m[34m{its}[0m doors to foreign investors in 1979 , [1m[34m{toy makers from Hong Kong}[0m were among the first to march in . 
(1) Today , with about 75 % of the [1m[34m{companies}[0m ' products being made in [4m[34m{China}[0m , [4m[33m{the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council , Dennis Ting ,}[0m has suggested a new sourcing label : `` Made in [4m[34m{China}[0m by [4m[32m{Hong Kong}[0m Companies . '' 
(2) [1m[34m{The toy makers}[0m were pushed across [4m[32m{the border}[0m by rising labor and land costs in [4m[32m{the British colony}[0m . 
(3) But in the wake of [3m[31m{the shootings in Beijing on June 4}[0m , [35m{the Hong Kong toy industry}[0m is worrying about [35m{its}[0m strong dependence on [4m[34m{China}[0m . 
(4) Although [1m[34m{the manufacturers}[0m stress that production has n't been affected by [4m[34m{China}[0m 's political turmoil , [1m[34m{they}[0m are looking for additional sites . 
(5) [1m[34m{The toy makers}[0m , and [1m[34m{their}[0m foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about [4m[34m{China}[0m 's economic and political policies . 
(6) `` [3m[33m{Nobody}[0m wants to have all [3m[33m{his}[0m eggs in one basket , '' says David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of [36m{International Matchbox Group Ltd}[0m . 
(7) Indeed , [32m{Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers}[0m were setting up factories in [4m[31m{Southeast Asia}[0m , especially in [3m[35m{Thailand}[0m , long before [3m[31m{the massacre}[0m . 
(8) [32m{Their}[0m steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in [3m[36m{southern China}[0m . 
(9) By diversifying supply sources , [32m{the toy makers}[0m do n't intend to withdraw from [4m[34m{China}[0m , manufacturers and foreign buyers say . 
(10) It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in [3m[36m{southern China}[0m during the past decade . 
(11) A supply of cheap labor and the access to [4m[32m{Hong Kong 's}[0m port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made [4m[34m{China}[0m 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site . 
(12) `` [3m[36m{South China}[0m is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says Henry Hu , executive director of [3m[34m{Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd}[0m . 
(13) [4m[32m{Hong Kong}[0m trade figures illustrate [1m[34m{the toy makers '}[0m reliance on factories across [4m[32m{the border}[0m . 
(14) In [3m[35m{1988}[0m , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from [4m[31m{1987}[0m , to HK$ 10.05 billion -LRB- US$ 1.29 billion -RRB- . 
(15) But re-exports , mainly from [4m[34m{China}[0m , jumped 75 % , to HK$ 15.92 billion . 
(16) In 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to HK$ 3.87 billion , while re-exports rose 56 % , to HK$ 11.28 billion . 
(17) [1m[34m{Manufacturers}[0m say there is no immediate substitute for [3m[36m{southern China , where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry}[0m . 
(18) `` For the next few years , like it or not , [4m[34m{China}[0m is going to be the main supplier , '' says Edmund Young , vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big [4m[32m{Hong Kong}[0m toy makers to move across [4m[32m{the border}[0m . 
(19) In the meantime , as [4m[33m{manufacturers and buyers}[0m seek new sites , [4m[33m{they}[0m are focusing mainly on [4m[31m{Southeast Asia}[0m . 
(20) Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in [3m[35m{Thailand}[0m , including [36m{Matchbox}[0m , [3m[34m{Wah Shing}[0m and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by [4m[33m{Mr. Ting}[0m . 
(21) Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied . 
(22) With [4m[34m{the European Community}[0m set to remove [4m[34m{its}[0m internal trade barriers in 1992 , several [4m[32m{Hong Kong}[0m companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites . 
(23) Worries about [4m[34m{China}[0m came just as [4m[32m{Hong Kong 's}[0m toy industry was recovering from [1m[31m{a 1987 sales slump}[0m and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc . 
(24) [4m[32m{Hong Kong}[0m manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from [1m[31m{the 1987 difficulties}[0m chastened [35m{the local industry}[0m , causing [35m{it}[0m to tighten credit policies and financial management . 
(25) [35m{The industry}[0m regards [3m[35m{last year}[0m and [4m[36m{this year}[0m as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results . 
(26) Still , [35m{they}[0m long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in [1m[36m{the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games}[0m . 
(27) The closest thing [34m{the colony 's companies}[0m have to a U.S. mega-hit [4m[36m{this year}[0m is the [3m[36m{Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles}[0m series of action figures manufactured by [4m[35m{Playmates Holdings Ltd}[0m . 
(28) Introduced in mid-1988 , [3m[36m{the 15 - centimeter - tall plastic turtles}[0m are based on an American comic book and television series . 
(29) [31m{Paul Kwan , managing director of Playmates ,}[0m says 10 million [3m[36m{Ninja Turtles}[0m have been sold , placing [3m[36m{the reptilian warriors}[0m among the 10 biggest - selling toys in [1m[36m{the U.S.}[0m . 
(30) Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , [31m{Mr. Kwan}[0m said [3m[36m{the Ninja Turtles}[0m could make [4m[36m{1989}[0m a record sales year for [4m[35m{Playmates}[0m . 
(31) [3m[34m{Other Hong Kong manufacturers}[0m expect [3m[34m{their}[0m results to improve only slightly [4m[36m{this year}[0m from [3m[35m{1988}[0m . 
(32) Besides the lack of a fast - selling product , [3m[34m{they}[0m cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by [1m[35m{Nintendo Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan}[0m . 
(33) [1m[35m{Nintendo}[0m buyers have little money left to spend on other products . 
(34) Many of [1m[34m{the toy makers '}[0m problems started well before [3m[32m{June 4}[0m as a result of overstrained infrastructure and [1m[32m{Beijing}[0m 's austerity programs launched late last year . 
(35) [1m[34m{Toy makers}[0m complain that electricity in [3m[33m{Guangdong}[0m has been provided only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the [3m[33m{province}[0m 's rapid industrialization has outstripped [3m[33m{its}[0m generating capacity . 
(36) [1m[34m{Manufacturers}[0m are upgrading standby power plants . 
(37) Bank credit for [4m[34m{China}[0m investments all but dried up following [3m[32m{June 4}[0m . 
(38) Also , concern exists that [33m{the harder - line Beijing leadership}[0m will tighten [33m{its}[0m control of [3m[33m{Guangdong , which has been the main laboratory for the open - door policy and economic reforms}[0m . 
(39) But , [1m[34m{toy manufacturers}[0m and other industrialists say [1m[32m{Beijing}[0m will be restrained from tightening controls on [3m[36m{export - oriented southern China}[0m . 
(40) [1m[33m{They}[0m say [4m[34m{China}[0m 's trade deficit is widening and [4m[34m{the country}[0m is too short of foreign exchange for [4m[34m{it}[0m to hamper production in [3m[33m{Guangdong}[0m . 
(41) `` [33m{The Chinese leaders}[0m have to decide whether [33m{they}[0m want control or whether [33m{the}[0m want exports , '' says [31m{Mr. Kwan of Playmates}[0m .
