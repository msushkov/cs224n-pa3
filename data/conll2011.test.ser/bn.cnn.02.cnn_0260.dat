(0) [3m[32m{We}[0m 're getting late word tonight that [4m[31m{Geraldo Rivera}[0m may not be [1m[33m{be}[0m kicked out of [36m{Iraq}[0m after all . 
(1) Originally [3m[34m{the Central Command}[0m said [4m[31m{the veteran Fox News correspond}[0m was being expelled because [4m[31m{he}[0m compromised [4m[32m{the location of the unit he 's been embedded with}[0m . 
(2) Now a spokesman from [3m[34m{the Central Command}[0m is saying and I 'm quoting `` Frankly , [3m[34m{we}[0m have bigger and more important things to do . '' 
(3) During a live broadcast [4m[31m{Geraldo}[0m drew a map in the sand showing [4m[32m{the location of the unit in relation to Baghdad}[0m . 
(4) Says [4m[31m{he}[0m 's not aware [4m[31m{he}[0m 's [1m[33m{being}[0m expelled but says if so , [1m[33m{it}[0m is because [4m[33m{some bitter former colleagues of his at MSNBC}[0m blew the whistle on [4m[31m{him}[0m . 
(5) It sounds to [4m[31m{me}[0m like [4m[33m{some rats at my former network , NBC ,}[0m are spreading some lies about [4m[31m{me}[0m . 
(6) You know , [4m[33m{they}[0m ca n't compete fair and square on the battlefield so [4m[33m{they}[0m 're trying to stab [4m[31m{me}[0m in the back . 
(7) It is not first time . 
(8) [3m[34m{The Central Command}[0m on the other hand says [4m[31m{Rivera}[0m is [1m[33m{being}[0m kicked out of [36m{Iraq}[0m because `` [4m[31m{he}[0m gave away the big picture stuff . '' 
(9) All of this now under review , whether or not [4m[31m{Geraldo}[0m stays or goes . 
(10) [3m[32m{We}[0m 'll continue to monitor that front on the store yix [1m[34m{another veteran war correspondent}[0m is being fired for [1m[34m{his}[0m controversial conduct in [36m{Iraq}[0m . 
(11) [1m[35m{NBC}[0m is terminating [1m[34m{freelancer reporter Peter Arnett}[0m for [3m[31m{statements he made to the Iraqi media}[0m . 
(12) [3m[32m{We}[0m showed you the [3m[31m{statements}[0m yesterday . 
(13) [1m[34m{He}[0m said the coalition 's first war plan had failed because of Iraqi resistance . 
(14) Today [1m[34m{he}[0m appeared on [1m[35m{NBC 's}[0m `` Today '' show and said [1m[34m{he}[0m was sorry . 
(15) [1m[34m{I}[0m want to apologize to the American people for clearly making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving [1m[32m{an interview}[0m to [3m[35m{Iraqi television}[0m . 
(16) Now , [1m[34m{I}[0m said in [1m[32m{that interview}[0m essentially what we all know about [35m{the war}[0m , there have been delays in implementing policy , there has been surprises , but clearly by giving [1m[32m{that interview}[0m to [3m[35m{Iraqi television}[0m , [1m[34m{I}[0m [34m{created}[0m a firestorm in the United States , and for [34m{that}[0m [1m[34m{I}[0m am truly sorry . 
(17) [1m[34m{Arnett}[0m had been covering [35m{the war}[0m for National Geographic , which also fired [1m[34m{him}[0m as TV reports were given exclusively to [1m[35m{NBC}[0m and MSNBC . 
(18) Late word from London that [1m[36m{the tabloid the Daily Mirror}[0m just hired [1m[34m{Peter Arnett}[0m to be [1m[36m{its}[0m correspondent in [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m . 
(19) But [4m[35m{the question}[0m remains Did [1m[34m{Peter Arnett}[0m and [4m[31m{Geraldo Rivera}[0m cross the line ? or were [3m[36m{they}[0m within [3m[36m{their}[0m rights as reporters ? 
(20) [3m[32m{We}[0m posed [4m[35m{that question}[0m to [3m[33m{Michael Wolf , a contributing editor for `` New York '' magazine , a media columnist , an important article in the new issue of `` New York}[0m . '' 
(21) [3m[33m{He}[0m 's joining [3m[32m{us}[0m now live from Qatar . 
(22) What do [3m[33m{you}[0m say to the question , [3m[33m{Michael}[0m ? 
(23) Well , you know , [3m[33m{I}[0m think [3m[33m{I}[0m 'm --
