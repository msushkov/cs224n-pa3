(0) [3m[33m{Congress}[0m learned during [3m[33m{the Reagan administration}[0m that [3m[33m{it}[0m could intimidate [3m[36m{the executive branch}[0m by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent ... . '' 
(1) [3m[35m{This phrase}[0m once again is found throughout [3m[34m{the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress}[0m . 
(2) [3m[35m{It}[0m signals [3m[33m{Congress 's}[0m attempt , under the pretext of guarding [4m[35m{the public purse}[0m , to deny [31m{the president}[0m the funding necessary to execute certain of [31m{his}[0m duties and prerogatives specified in [4m[32m{Article II of the Constitution}[0m . 
(3) This species of congressional action is predicated on [1m[34m{an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional}[0m . 
(4) [31m{The appropriations clause}[0m states that `` No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ... . '' 
(5) [1m[34m{The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill}[0m is that [31m{it}[0m gives [3m[33m{Congress}[0m an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of [31m{the president}[0m through the ability to withhold funding . 
(6) [1m[34m{This interpretation}[0m was officially endorsed by [3m[33m{Congress}[0m in 1987 in the Iran - Contra Report . 
(7) As partisans of congressional power understand , [34m{a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed}[0m would emasculate [1m[31m{the presidency}[0m and swallow the principle of separation of powers . 
(8) [34m{It}[0m is not supported by the text or history of [4m[32m{the Constitution}[0m . 
(9) [3m[32m{The framers}[0m hardly discussed [31m{the appropriations clause}[0m at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to [1m[36m{Madison 's}[0m notes . 
(10) To the extent [3m[32m{they}[0m did , [3m[32m{their}[0m concern was to ensure fiscal accountability . 
(11) Moreover , [3m[32m{the framers}[0m believed that [4m[34m{the nation}[0m needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation . 
(12) It would contradict that objective if [31m{the appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB-}[0m could be read as placing [31m{the president}[0m on [3m[33m{Congress 's}[0m short leash , making [1m[32m{the executive}[0m consist of [31m{the president}[0m and every member of [3m[33m{Congress}[0m . 
(13) As [4m[36m{it}[0m went to the conference panel now deliberating , [4m[36m{the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990}[0m contained [3m[35m{some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money}[0m . 
(14) During the coming weeks , [33m{President Bush}[0m must decide whether to veto [3m[31m{the bills containing them}[0m -- or , alternatively , to sign [3m[31m{these bills}[0m into law with a statement declaring [3m[31m{their}[0m intrusions on executive power to be in violation of [4m[32m{Article II}[0m , and thus void and severable . 
(15) [4m[36m{The 1990 appropriations legislation}[0m attempts to strip [31m{the president}[0m of [31m{his}[0m powers to make certain appointments as provided by [4m[32m{Article II}[0m . 
(16) [4m[32m{Article II}[0m places on [31m{the president}[0m the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of [3m[36m{the Senate}[0m '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of [4m[34m{the U.S.}[0m . 
(17) [4m[32m{It}[0m also empowers [31m{the president}[0m to make recess appointments , without [3m[36m{Senate}[0m approval : `` [31m{The President}[0m shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of [3m[36m{the Senate}[0m , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of [3m[36m{their}[0m next Session . '' 
(18) Yet [4m[35m{Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office}[0m provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to [4m[31m{any person}[0m for the filling of any position for which [4m[31m{he or she}[0m has been nominated after [3m[36m{the Senate}[0m has voted not to approve the nomination of [4m[31m{said person}[0m . '' 
(19) Thus , with one brief passage in [4m[36m{an appropriations bill}[0m , [3m[33m{Congress}[0m repeals [31m{the president 's}[0m power to make recess appointments under [4m[32m{Article II}[0m . 
(20) [4m[35m{Section 605}[0m also imposes unconstitutional conditions on [31m{the president 's}[0m ability to nominate candidates of [31m{his}[0m choosing . 
(21) The language of [4m[35m{the appropriations rider}[0m implies that any nomination to any position of [32m{a rejected nominee}[0m will result in [31m{the president}[0m being denied funding to pay [32m{that person 's}[0m salary . 
(22) [31m{The president}[0m could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to [3m[32m{serve}[0m without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits [3m[32m{voluntary service to the government}[0m . 
(23) [3m[34m{The 1990 appropriations bills}[0m also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in [4m[32m{Article II of the Constitution}[0m . 
(24) [4m[33m{Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well ,}[0m prevent [3m[36m{the executive branch}[0m from even looking at [32m{certain policy options}[0m , let alone from recommending [32m{them}[0m to [3m[33m{Congress}[0m . 
(25) Such laws violate the provision in [4m[32m{Article II}[0m that requires [31m{the president}[0m to make [35m{recommendations}[0m to [3m[33m{Congress}[0m , but which gives [31m{the president}[0m the discretion to select the subject matter of [35m{those recommendations}[0m . 
(26) Typically , [4m[33m{these laws}[0m seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market - oriented alternatives to regulations . 
(27) Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in [4m[36m{the appropriations bill for the executive office}[0m that prevents [31m{the president 's}[0m Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost - benefit scrutiny . 
(28) There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting [1m[32m{the executive}[0m from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . 
(29) Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in [3m[34m{the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990}[0m better illustrates [3m[33m{Congress 's}[0m attempt to usurp executive power than [36m{Section 609 of the executive - office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States}[0m . '' 
(30) [36m{This provision}[0m amounts to a legislative veto over [31m{the president 's}[0m execution of the law , since [4m[36m{a one - house resolution}[0m could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though [4m[36m{it}[0m would require neither bicameral action in [3m[33m{Congress}[0m nor presentation to [31m{the president}[0m for [31m{his}[0m signature or veto . 
(31) [3m[31m{The Supreme Court 's}[0m decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional . 
(32) [33m{President Bush}[0m should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on [31m{the president 's}[0m ability to discharge [31m{his}[0m duties and exercise [31m{his}[0m prerogatives . 
(33) If [33m{President Bush}[0m fails to do so in [33m{his}[0m first year , [33m{he}[0m will invite [3m[33m{Congress}[0m , for the remainder of [33m{his}[0m presidency , to rewrite [4m[32m{Article II of the Constitution}[0m to suit [3m[33m{its}[0m purposes . 
(34) What becomes custom in the [33m{Bush}[0m administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo . 
(35) [4m[34m{President Reagan}[0m learned that lesson . 
(36) By 1987 , then - Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct [4m[34m{the president}[0m , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though [3m[36m{the Senate}[0m had ratified SALT II . 
(37) If [1m[35m{a veto}[0m is unworkable because [1m[35m{it}[0m would leave part of [3m[36m{the executive branch}[0m unfunded , [31m{the president}[0m could sign [3m[34m{the appropriations bills}[0m into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting [31m{his}[0m [4m[32m{Article II}[0m powers to be unconstitutional and severable . 
(38) [4m[32m{The Constitution}[0m does not expressly give [31m{the president}[0m such power . 
(39) However , [31m{the president}[0m does have a duty not to violate [4m[32m{the Constitution}[0m . 
(40) The question is whether [31m{his}[0m only means of defense is the veto . 
(41) Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on [31m{the president 's}[0m duties and prerogative under [4m[32m{Article II}[0m would be different from the line - item veto . 
(42) As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line - item veto is characterized as a way for [31m{the president}[0m to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with [31m{his}[0m policy objectives . 
(43) The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . 
(44) One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for [31m{the president}[0m , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate [1m[33m{the separation of powers}[0m . 
(45) There is no downside if [33m{the president}[0m asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in [3m[34m{the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills}[0m . 
(46) If [3m[33m{Congress}[0m does nothing , [33m{President Bush}[0m will have won . 
(47) If [3m[33m{Congress}[0m takes the dispute to [3m[31m{the Supreme Court}[0m -LRB- assuming [3m[33m{it}[0m can establish standing to sue -RRB- , [33m{President Bush}[0m might win . 
(48) In that case , [33m{he}[0m might receive an opinion from [3m[31m{the court}[0m that is a vindication of [31m{the president 's}[0m right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives [3m[32m{the framers}[0m thought should be entrusted to [1m[32m{the executive}[0m . 
(49) If [33m{President Bush}[0m loses at [3m[31m{the court}[0m , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was for [3m[33m{the Reagan administration}[0m . 
(50) But [1m[31m{the presidency}[0m would be no worse off than [1m[31m{it}[0m is now . 
(51) Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how [1m[33m{the separation of powers}[0m works in practice . 
(52) As it stands now , [3m[33m{Congress}[0m presumes after [3m[33m{the Reagan administration}[0m that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down . 
(53) [33m{President Bush}[0m should set things straight . 
(54) If [33m{he}[0m does not , [33m{he}[0m will help realize [1m[36m{Madison 's}[0m fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . '' 
(55) [3m[34m{Mr. Sidak}[0m served as an attorney in [3m[33m{the Reagan administration}[0m . 
(56) [3m[34m{His}[0m longer analysis of executive power and [31m{the appropriations clause}[0m is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year .
