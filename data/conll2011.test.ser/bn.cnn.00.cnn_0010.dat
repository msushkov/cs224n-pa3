(0) Thanks for joining [3m[32m{us}[0m . 
(1) Here 's [3m[32m{our}[0m story this half hour -- 
(2) There 's dancing in [4m[31m{the streets of Belgrade}[0m as [34m{angry demonstrations}[0m have turned into celebrations . 
(3) Tens of thousands of people crowded [4m[31m{the streets of the Yugoslavian capital}[0m [32m{today}[0m after the apparent overthrow of [1m[34m{President Slobodan Milosevic}[0m . 
(4) Yesterday , protesters stormed key government buildings and seized Serb state television in [1m[35m{Belgrade}[0m . 
(5) [4m[32m{Russia}[0m has joined [3m[33m{the West}[0m in [3m[33m{its}[0m support of [36m{opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica}[0m . 
(6) [1m[33m{Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov}[0m congratulated [36m{Kostunica}[0m on [36m{his}[0m election victory . 
(7) [1m[33m{He}[0m also gave [36m{him}[0m a letter from [3m[35m{Russian President Vladimir Putin}[0m . 
(8) [3m[35m{Putin}[0m says [3m[35m{he}[0m hopes [36m{the opposition leader}[0m will do `` everything possible to overcome the internal political crisis '' in [1m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m . 
(9) [4m[32m{Russia}[0m was the last European power to withhold support for [33m{the opposition}[0m . 
(10) [1m[34m{The man who lost power in Yugoslavia}[0m finally surfaced [32m{today}[0m . 
(11) [1m[34m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m met with [1m[33m{Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov}[0m . 
(12) [1m[33m{Ivanov}[0m says [1m[34m{Milosevic}[0m told [1m[33m{him}[0m [1m[34m{he}[0m plans to remain in [3m[34m{Serbia}[0m and continue to run [3m[34m{its}[0m largest political party . 
(13) Indeed [1m[34m{Milosevic}[0m still considers [1m[34m{himself}[0m to be President , according to [1m[34m{his}[0m brother Borislav . 
(14) In an interview with [3m[32m{CNN}[0m , [3m[31m{Borislav Milosevic}[0m accused Western nations of supporting [34m{the demonstrations}[0m and said [3m[31m{his}[0m brother has no plans to leave [1m[35m{the city}[0m . 
(15) Regardless of how many votes [36m{Mr. Kostunica}[0m received , [1m[31m{the actions that took place last night}[0m are vandalism . 
(16) [1m[31m{It}[0m 's violence . 
(17) [1m[31m{It}[0m should n't have happened . 
(18) That 's not democracy . 
(19) [33m{The opposition}[0m did n't accept the ruling of the constitutional court and began to storm the parliament , which was not being defended , and inflicted huge material damage , but [33m{it}[0m also did more damage to our institutions . 
(20) The next step in the transition to a new government is for [3m[36m{the Yugoslav parliament}[0m to convene . 
(21) A commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to [1m[35m{Belgrade}[0m for a special session . 
(22) Alessio Vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of [3m[36m{parliament}[0m will have to travel to [1m[35m{Belgrade}[0m from Montenegro . 
(23) What is going on right now is intense negotiations with all the members of [3m[36m{parliament}[0m that were elected on September trying to get the majority needed in order to swear in [36m{Vojislav Kostunica}[0m as the next President of [1m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m . 
(24) With the events of the past week in [1m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m , the world is getting to know the name of [36m{Vojislav Kostunica}[0m . 
(25) Jonathan Mann takes a look at [36m{the man}[0m and [36m{his}[0m politics . 
(26) Unlike [1m[34m{President Milosevic}[0m , [36m{he}[0m was not a Communist in the long years when party membership was the key to power . 
(27) [36m{He}[0m was not among the prominent opposition figures who have struggled against each other almost as hard as [35m{the regime}[0m . 
(28) [36m{He}[0m is an orthodox Serb nationalist , but [36m{he}[0m supports truer democracy for [36m{his}[0m country and better relations with [1m[32m{its}[0m neighbors and [3m[33m{the West}[0m . 
(29) [36m{Kostunica}[0m is a soft - spoken and uncharismatic figure who spent years building the Democratic Party of Serbia and gathering only modest support . 
(30) After ten years , people know what are the differences between [1m[34m{Milosevic 's}[0m policies and ours , what [1m[34m{Milosevic}[0m was saying and promising and what the opposition parties and [36m{I myself}[0m was saying in these years and how [36m{I}[0m was behaving . 
(31) [36m{Kostunica}[0m is 56 , an expert on constitutional law who lives with [36m{his}[0m wife and pets in a [1m[35m{Belgrade}[0m apartment . 
(32) [36m{He}[0m was fired from [36m{his}[0m job teaching law in 1974 for [36m{his}[0m opposition to the policies of the Tito government . 
(33) [36m{He}[0m refused an offer to return in 1989 because of [36m{his}[0m opposition to [35m{the Milosevic regime}[0m , and [36m{he}[0m rejects much from [3m[33m{the West}[0m as well -- the Dayton peace accord , Western sanctions on [1m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m , and the war crimes tribunal . 
(34) In the months before the election , [36m{he}[0m was careful to distinguish between [36m{his}[0m support for [31m{European aid projects tied to reform}[0m and U.S. efforts , which [36m{he}[0m describes as unhelpful , even to [35m{the opposition}[0m . 
(35) [36m{I}[0m know what the support means when [1m[32m{we}[0m get from European Union , the programs like energy for democracy , school for democracy . 
(36) [31m{Those small projects .}[0m 
(37) Here [1m[32m{we}[0m get nothing in advance , just a political support which consists of nothing , and which is mostly used and abused and manipulated by [35m{the regime}[0m , saying [1m[36m{they}[0m are just NATO parties , as is often said by regime , [1m[36m{they}[0m are not having [1m[36m{their}[0m own policy . 
(38) Jonathan Mann , [3m[32m{CNN}[0m . 
(39) [3m[32m{We}[0m 'll be following the events in [1m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m all day .
