(2) In an attempt to appease [3m[31m{U.S. regulators '}[0m concern over a [1m[31m{Goldsmith}[0m acquisition of [1m[34m{Farmers}[0m , [1m[31m{Sir James}[0m in August [35m{agreed}[0m to [4m[35m{sell}[0m [1m[34m{Farmers}[0m to [34m{Axa}[0m if [1m[31m{he}[0m is successful in acquiring [1m[32m{B.A.T}[0m . 
(3) As part of [35m{the agreement}[0m , [34m{Axa}[0m agreed to invest $ 1 billion in [3m[33m{Hoylake Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle}[0m . 
(4) Of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to [3m[33m{Hoylake}[0m by [34m{Axa}[0m , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of [34m{Axa}[0m 's parent , Axa - Midi Group , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by [34m{Axa}[0m , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long - term bank loans . 
(5) In an interview Thursday , [36m{Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa ,}[0m said [36m{his}[0m group has already obtained assurances from [3m[32m{a group of banks led by Cie . Financiere de Paribas}[0m that [33m{they}[0m can provide the loan portion of the financing . 
(6) The other banking companies in [3m[32m{the group}[0m are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , [36m{he}[0m said . 
(7) [36m{Mr. Bebear}[0m said [33m{Axa - Midi Group}[0m has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of [31m{non-strategic assets}[0m that [33m{we}[0m can and will sell '' to help pay off [1m[36m{debt from the acquisition}[0m . 
(8) [36m{He}[0m said [31m{the assets to be sold}[0m would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of [1m[34m{Farmers}[0m . 
(9) `` [33m{We}[0m wo n't put any burden on [1m[34m{Farmers}[0m , '' [36m{he}[0m said . 
(10) [3m[34m{The amended filings}[0m also point out that under a new agreement , [3m[33m{Hoylake}[0m has an absolute obligation to sell [1m[34m{Farmers}[0m to [34m{Axa}[0m upon an acquisition of [1m[32m{B.A.T}[0m . 
(11) `` [33m{We}[0m hope that with what [33m{we}[0m did , [3m[31m{the regulators}[0m will not need to evaluate [3m[33m{Hoylake}[0m , and [3m[31m{they}[0m can directly look at [35m{the agreement}[0m with [33m{us}[0m , because [3m[33m{Hoylake}[0m wo n't be an owner of [1m[34m{Farmers}[0m at anytime , '' [36m{Mr. Bebear}[0m said . 
(12) Any change of control in [1m[34m{Farmers}[0m needs approval of the insurance commissioners in [3m[35m{the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated}[0m . 
(13) [3m[34m{The amended filings}[0m were required because of [35m{the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake}[0m , and to reflect [1m[33m{the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition}[0m . 
(14) [3m[33m{Hoylake}[0m dropped [3m[33m{its}[0m initial # 13.35 billion -LRB- $ 20.71 billion -RRB- takeover bid after [3m[33m{it}[0m received [1m[33m{the extension}[0m , but said [3m[33m{it}[0m would launch a new bid if and when [4m[35m{the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa}[0m receives regulatory approval . 
(15) [4m[36m{A spokesman for B.A.T}[0m said of [3m[34m{the amended filings}[0m that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed . 
(16) [3m[34m{The new financing structure}[0m is still a very - highly leveraged one , and [34m{Axa}[0m still plans to take out [32m{75 % of Farmers ' earnings}[0m as dividends to service [34m{their}[0m debt . '' 
(17) [32m{That dividend}[0m is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of [1m[34m{Farmers}[0m by [1m[32m{B.A.T}[0m , [4m[36m{the spokesman}[0m added . 
(18) `` [32m{It}[0m would have severe implications for [1m[34m{Farmers}[0m ' policy holders . '' 
(19) To fend off [1m[31m{Sir James 's}[0m advances , [1m[32m{B.A.T}[0m has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare [1m[32m{it}[0m to a tobacco and financial services concern .
