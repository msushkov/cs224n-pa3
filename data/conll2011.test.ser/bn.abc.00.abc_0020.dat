(19) [1m[35m{American investigators}[0m also say the way [34m{the bombers}[0m organized the plot in [3m[35m{Aden}[0m has stark similarities to the way [4m[34m{Bin Laden 's}[0m cells have operated in the past , but , [1m[35m{they}[0m concede , while [1m[35m{they}[0m are closer to learning the names of [34m{the bombers}[0m , [1m[35m{they}[0m are still a long way from knowing or proving who sent [34m{them}[0m .
