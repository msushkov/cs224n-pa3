(0) [1m[34m{Government officials here and in other countries}[0m laid plans through the [31m{weekend}[0m to head off a [33m{Monday}[0m market meltdown -- but went out of [1m[34m{their}[0m way to keep [1m[34m{their}[0m moves quiet . 
(1) [31m{Federal Reserve}[0m Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that [31m{the Fed}[0m was prepared to [1m[36m{inject}[0m massive amounts of money into [1m[32m{the banking system}[0m , as [31m{it}[0m did in [32m{October 1987}[0m , if [1m[36m{the action}[0m were needed to prevent a financial crisis . 
(2) And at [4m[32m{the Treasury}[0m , [4m[35m{Secretary Nicholas Brady}[0m talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while [4m[35m{Assistant Secretary David Mullins}[0m carefully analyzed data on [4m[33m{the Friday market plunge}[0m . 
(3) But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters . 
(4) In addition , officials at [31m{the Fed}[0m and in [3m[35m{the Bush administration}[0m decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over [31m{the weekend}[0m would give them more strength and flexibility should [1m[33m{Friday}[0m 's [36m{market}[0m drop turn into this morning 's rout . 
(5) `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything [3m[34m{you}[0m do that looks like [3m[34m{you}[0m are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity . 
(6) The [31m{Fed}[0m 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled [4m[31m{Sunday}[0m morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried [33m{stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning}[0m . 
(7) [31m{Fed}[0m Chairman Greenspan was surprised by [33m{both stories}[0m , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted [3m[31m{he}[0m had n't authorized any public comment . 
(8) Nevertheless , [31m{Fed}[0m officials acknowledged [33m{the stories}[0m were reasonably accurate portrayals of [31m{the central bank 's}[0m game plan . 
(9) [31m{It}[0m is prepared to assume the same role [31m{it}[0m played in [32m{October 1987}[0m , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat . 
(10) The Fed provides money to [1m[32m{the banking system}[0m by buying government securities from financial institutions . 
(11) The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance [4m[31m{Sunday}[0m of [1m[35m{Budget Director Richard Darman}[0m on ABC 's `` This Week . '' 
(12) `` [4m[35m{Secretary of the Treasury Brady}[0m and [3m[31m{Chairman Greenspan}[0m and the chairman of [36m{the SEC}[0m and others have been in close contact . 
(13) [1m[35m{I}[0m 'm sure [3m[33m{they}[0m 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's sensible , '' [1m[35m{he}[0m said . 
(14) When it was suggested [1m[35m{his}[0m comment was a `` non-answer , '' [1m[35m{Mr. Darman}[0m replied : `` [35m{It}[0m is a non-answer . 
(15) But , in this context , [35m{that}[0m 's the smart thing to do . '' 
(16) At [4m[32m{the Treasury}[0m , [4m[35m{Secretary Brady}[0m issued a statement minimizing [36m{the stock market 's}[0m drop . 
(17) `` Today 's stock [36m{market}[0m decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of [4m[31m{the economy}[0m , '' [4m[35m{he}[0m said . 
(18) `` [4m[31m{The economy}[0m remains well - balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' 
(19) But [3m[35m{administration}[0m officials conceded that [1m[33m{Friday}[0m 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week . 
(20) `` One possibility is that [4m[33m{this}[0m is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said [35m{one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named}[0m . 
(21) `` The other is that we see [1m[31m{another major disaster , like two years ago}[0m . 
(22) [35m{I}[0m think [1m[31m{that}[0m 's less likely . '' 
(23) Nevertheless , [31m{Fed}[0m Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in [4m[34m{their}[0m offices [4m[31m{Sunday}[0m evening , monitoring [4m[32m{events}[0m as [4m[32m{they}[0m unfolded in markets around the world . 
(24) The action was expected to begin with the opening of the [4m[36m{New Zealand}[0m foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks [4m[36m{there}[0m plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in [4m[33m{Tokyo}[0m and through early this morning in Europe . 
(25) Both [4m[32m{the Treasury}[0m and [31m{the Fed}[0m planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments . 
(26) In [4m[33m{Tokyo}[0m , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early [33m{Monday}[0m morning trading . 
(27) After the initial slide , [36m{the market}[0m appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower . 
(28) In [3m[35m{the Bush administration}[0m , the lead is being taken by [4m[32m{Treasury}[0m Secretary Brady , Undersecretary Robert Glauber and [4m[35m{Assistant Secretary Mullins}[0m . 
(29) [3m[32m{The three men}[0m worked together on the so - called Brady Commission , headed by [4m[35m{Mr. Brady}[0m , which was established after the 1987 crash to examine the [36m{market}[0m 's collapse . 
(30) As a result [3m[32m{they}[0m have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises . 
(31) [4m[35m{Mr. Brady}[0m was at the White House [1m[33m{Friday}[0m afternoon when [36m{the stock market 's}[0m decline began . 
(32) [4m[35m{He}[0m was quickly on the phone with [4m[35m{Mr. Mullins , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges}[0m . 
(33) Later , [4m[35m{Mr. Brady}[0m phoned [3m[31m{Mr. Greenspan}[0m , [36m{SEC}[0m Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in [4m[34m{New York}[0m and overseas . 
(34) Aides say [4m[35m{he}[0m continued to work the phones through [31m{the weekend}[0m . 
(35) [3m[35m{Administration}[0m officials say [4m[36m{President Bush}[0m was briefed throughout [1m[33m{Friday}[0m afternoon and evening , even after leaving for Camp David . 
(36) [4m[36m{He}[0m had frequent telephone consultations with [4m[35m{Mr. Brady}[0m and Michael Boskin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers . 
(37) Government officials tried throughout [31m{the weekend}[0m to render a business - as - usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic . 
(38) [4m[32m{Treasury}[0m Undersecretary David Mulford , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in [34m{Hot Springs , Va. ,}[0m when [36m{the stock market}[0m [4m[33m{fell}[0m , and remained [34m{there}[0m through the following day . 
(39) And as of last night , [31m{Fed}[0m Chairman Greenspan had n't canceled [3m[31m{his}[0m plans to address [34m{the American Bankers Association convention}[0m in [3m[36m{Washington}[0m at 10 a.m. this morning . 
(40) Ironically , [3m[31m{Mr. Greenspan}[0m was scheduled to address [34m{the same convention}[0m in [32m{Dallas}[0m on Oct. 20 , 1987 . 
(41) [3m[31m{He}[0m flew to [32m{Dallas}[0m on Oct. 19 , when [36m{the market}[0m plummeted 508 points , but then turned around the next morning and returned to [3m[36m{Washington}[0m without delivering [3m[31m{his}[0m speech .
