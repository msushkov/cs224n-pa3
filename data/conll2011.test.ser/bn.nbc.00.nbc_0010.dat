(1) 316 were aboard [3m[36m{the `` USS Cole ''}[0m when the terrorists [1m[31m{struck}[0m . 
(2) Dozens were injured . 
(3) 17 were killed . 
(4) [3m[35m{Our}[0m coverage begins with [3m[35m{NBC 's}[0m Joe Johns . 
(5) A plane carrying the bodies of five dead American sailors from [3m[36m{the `` USS Cole ''}[0m arrived [4m[33m{today}[0m at Dover Air Force Base , as [3m[32m{the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the Department of Defense and the FBI}[0m arrived in [3m[33m{Yemen}[0m . 
(6) [3m[32m{Their}[0m mission -- to continue [36m{the search for evidence and suspects in the explosion}[0m . 
(7) Also on the way , equipment to lift [3m[36m{the `` Cole ''}[0m out of the water and specialists to help retrieve [33m{the bodies of those trapped and presumed dead}[0m . 
(8) [35m{We}[0m know there are [4m[31m{spaces that are inaccessible}[0m . 
(9) [35m{We}[0m know there are [3m[31m{some remains in those spaces}[0m .

(13) This critical phase of [36m{the investigation}[0m must be conducted both above and beneath the water on a tight time line . 
(14) They 'll want to get in there quickly because one of the problems when you 're dealing with [1m[34m{seawater}[0m is that [1m[34m{it}[0m will have an adverse effect on your evidence . 
(15) To further speed up the process , [1m[35m{the FBI}[0m has now activated the Strategic Information and Operation Center in [4m[32m{Washington}[0m , conceived after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers . 
(16) On the diplomatic front , the U.S. said [3m[33m{the government of Yemen}[0m is cooperating with [36m{the investigation}[0m , though [3m[33m{that country 's}[0m President disputes charges that [3m[34m{his}[0m nation is a haven for terrorists . 
(17) [1m[36m{The Justice Department}[0m says no group or individual has been ruled out as a suspect , though many expect that whoever gets the blame will eventually be tied to the terrorist Osama bin Laden . 
(18) And the grieving continued [4m[33m{today}[0m at the Naval Academy 's football game against Notre Dame . 
(19) A moment of silence to remember the victims of [1m[31m{this terrorist act}[0m . 
(20) [1m[32m{Joe Johns}[0m , [3m[35m{NBC News}[0m .
