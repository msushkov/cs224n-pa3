(0) From Texas politics now to [4m[33m{Chinese censorship}[0m . 
(1) [32m{China}[0m [4m[31m{today}[0m blacked out a CNN interview that was critical of [32m{the Chinese government 's}[0m handling of the SARs epidemic and of [32m{the country 's}[0m health care system . 
(2) [32m{China}[0m requires foreign broadcasters to use [33m{a Chinese satellite}[0m to serve [32m{their country}[0m . 
(3) Until last month [33m{it}[0m was routinely [3m[35m{blocking}[0m almost all reports about Sars in [32m{China}[0m , [3m[35m{a practice that has produced intense global criticism}[0m . 
(4) [31m{The British Broadcasting Company}[0m has also faced [4m[33m{the censorship in China}[0m . 
(5) In 1993 [4m[35m{Rupert Murdoch}[0m bought a controlling stake in [32m{China 's}[0m Star TV satellite system . 
(6) In 1994 the BBC World Service broadcasts were pulled from [4m[34m{Star}[0m . 
(7) [32m{China}[0m was offended by [31m{the BBC 's}[0m news content and demanded that [4m[34m{STAR TV}[0m remove [34m{it}[0m or lose permission to broadcast in [32m{China}[0m . 
(8) A year later [4m[35m{Murdoch}[0m bought the rest of [4m[34m{Star TV}[0m that [4m[35m{he}[0m did not own . 
(9) [4m[35m{Rupert Murdoch 's}[0m News Corp. has [3m[36m{an extensive presence}[0m , of course in [32m{this country}[0m . 
(10) [3m[36m{That presence}[0m may be expanding soon , if [4m[32m{the FCC}[0m [35m{eases}[0m some of [4m[32m{its}[0m broadcast rules . 
(11) [4m[35m{Murdoch}[0m has lobbied hard for [35m{those changes}[0m . 
(12) [35m{They}[0m would allow [4m[35m{him}[0m to buy even more U.S. television stations . 
(13) Next month [4m[32m{the FCC}[0m is likely to accommodate [4m[35m{him}[0m . 
(14) [4m[35m{Murdoch}[0m [4m[31m{today}[0m promised that if [4m[36m{the rules}[0m are changed [4m[35m{he}[0m will limit future purchases to a few of what [4m[35m{he}[0m calls sizable markets .
