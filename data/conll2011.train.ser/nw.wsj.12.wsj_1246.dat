(0) [4m[34m{Two Japanese scientists}[0m [1m[35m{said}[0m [4m[34m{they}[0m [1m[36m{discovered}[0m [36m{an antibody that , in laboratory test - tube experiments , kills AIDS - infected cells while preserving healthy cells}[0m . 
(1) If [3m[35m{further experiments}[0m are successful , [3m[35m{the work}[0m would represent a major advance in research on [3m[33m{acquired immune deficiency syndrome}[0m . 
(2) [3m[31m{The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market ,}[0m claims only to help stop the spread of [3m[33m{AIDS}[0m , not to cure [3m[33m{it}[0m . 
(3) But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was announced at a conference in Nagoya [4m[31m{yesterday}[0m , expressed skepticism over the significance of [1m[34m{the results}[0m . 
(4) And [4m[34m{the researchers themselves}[0m acknowledged [4m[34m{they}[0m still must do much more work before [4m[34m{they}[0m can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans . 
(5) [1m[31m{Shin Yonehara , a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science ,}[0m said [36m{the antibody he discovered}[0m works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas - antigen , which is characteristic of [3m[32m{an infected cell}[0m . 
(6) [36m{The antibody}[0m then kills [3m[32m{the cell}[0m . 
(7) [1m[31m{Dr. Yonehara}[0m and [1m[31m{his}[0m partner , Nobuyuki Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University , said [4m[34m{their}[0m experiments showed that [36m{the antibody}[0m wiped out an average of 60 % of [3m[33m{AIDS - infected}[0m cells within three days . 
(8) In some of [4m[33m{the experiments}[0m , [36m{it}[0m killed almost all the infected cells , [4m[34m{the researchers}[0m said . 
(9) Meanwhile , fewer than 10 % of the healthy cells were killed . 
(10) [4m[34m{The two}[0m said [4m[34m{they}[0m must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals . 
(11) [4m[34m{They}[0m said [4m[34m{they}[0m hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the U.S. by late next year . 
(12) [1m[33m{Japan}[0m does n't have enough [3m[33m{AIDS}[0m patients to do significant experimentation in [1m[33m{that country}[0m , [4m[34m{they}[0m said . 
(13) [1m[35m{The announcement}[0m got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks [4m[31m{yesterday}[0m . 
(14) But [4m[32m{Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS - research center ,}[0m said , `` [4m[32m{I}[0m 'm not so optimistic of [36m{its}[0m future use in therapeutic methods . '' 
(15) [4m[32m{He}[0m said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to [36m{the antibody}[0m . 
(16) `` [1m[34m{The results}[0m seem to be very premature , '' said Mitsuru Miyata , editor of Nikkei Biotechnology , a leading Japanese industry newsletter . 
(17) [3m[36m{Dr. Kobayashi}[0m responded that [3m[36m{he}[0m thought [36m{the antibody}[0m could potentially kill all infected cells . 
(18) But [3m[36m{he}[0m and [1m[31m{Dr. Yonehara}[0m said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects . 
(19) `` [4m[34m{Our}[0m antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but [36m{it}[0m can also kill other cells , '' said [1m[31m{Dr. Yonehara}[0m . 
(20) `` [4m[34m{We}[0m do n't know the effect of [4m[34m{our}[0m antibody on the human body . '' 
(21) [3m[33m{AIDS}[0m is n't considered a widespread problem in [1m[33m{Japan}[0m -- [1m[33m{the government}[0m reports about 1,000 known carriers of [3m[33m{the virus}[0m -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years , hoping to cash in on a possible cure . 
(22) [4m[32m{Dr. Kitamura}[0m said about 35 projects are currently under way in [1m[33m{Japan}[0m , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests . 
(23) [4m[32m{He}[0m said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in January in New Orleans , the Japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing . 
(24) [3m[31m{AZT}[0m is the world 's only prescription medicine approved for treating [3m[33m{the disease}[0m . 
(25) [3m[34m{Wellcome PLC , a major British pharmaceutical maker ,}[0m sells [3m[31m{the drug}[0m under [1m[32m{the name Retrovir}[0m . 
(26) A [3m[34m{Wellcome}[0m spokesman declined to comment on [1m[36m{the discovery of the antibody in Japan}[0m . 
(27) But Andrew Porter , a drug - industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co. in London , said if [36m{the product}[0m were to be successfully developed [36m{it}[0m would represent `` a potential threat to the long - term viability of [1m[32m{Retrovir}[0m .
