(0) Adrenaline is high on the flight deck of [35m{this carrier at war}[0m . 
(1) Soon after dawn on [3m[32m{this fourth day}[0m , confirmation of [35m{the ship 's}[0m first strike . 
(2) [3m[32m{Fourth day of combat operations}[0m [3m[32m{today}[0m bore fruit for the air wing and the ship team here . 
(3) [36m{We}[0m had F aircraft drop laser - guided bombs , Fs drop Joint Direct Attack Munitions or J - DAM weapons into eastern Afghanistan [3m[32m{today}[0m . 
(4) [1m[34m{This}[0m is the first of an unknown number of strikes [36m{we}[0m 'll conduct during [36m{our}[0m watch in `` Operation Enduring Freedom . '' 
(5) [32m{They}[0m 'll come back high - fiving and feeling pretty good about it but it is a bit of a somber event that [32m{they}[0m 're going through out here . 
(6) But the biggest thing you 're seeing is the intensity . 
(7) Reporter : 
(8) [3m[34m{The fighter jets}[0m dropped [3m[34m{their}[0m ordnance in [1m[34m{a coordinated atack on a convoy near the Afghan city of Choft}[0m . 
(9) The Pentagon says [4m[36m{the convoy}[0m was [1m[36m{Taliban}[0m and al Qaeda troops . 
(10) There was [1m[34m{an attack on a convoy of leadership that was identified through various intelligence means}[0m . 
(11) [1m[34m{That}[0m was done within the last 24 hours . 
(12) Reporter : 
(13) But the strikes prove controversial . 
(14) Local Afghans in [4m[36m{the convoy}[0m say [4m[36m{it}[0m was [1m[32m{a group of elders on their way to the inaugural ceremony for interim Afghan leader Hamid Karzai}[0m . 
(15) Analysts believe some tribal warlords may have taken advantage of American firepower by accusing rival leaders of being [1m[36m{Taliban}[0m and misguiding U.S. intelligence . 
(16) The consequence of injuring or hurting someone who is friendly or nonparticipant in combat is very difficult to deal with , and we go to extreme details in -- and do a lot of training as well to make sure that does n't happen . 
(17) [1m[33m{We}[0m have dropped ordnance [3m[32m{today}[0m , and I 'm sure [1m[33m{we}[0m 'll continue to [4m[33m{drop}[0m ordnance , and do [4m[33m{it}[0m with precision , do [4m[33m{it}[0m with accuracy , and do [4m[33m{it}[0m on call when needed first time every time . 
(18) Holy , holy , holy . 
(19) Reporter : 
(20) As [35m{the `` John C. Stennis ''}[0m ends [35m{its}[0m first week of operations in the Arabian Sea , [1m[31m{Christmas}[0m is only a few days away . 
(21) Though a choir rehearses in the chapel for a [1m[31m{Christmas}[0m event , for [1m[35m{the crew}[0m , [1m[31m{it}[0m is another workday , [1m[35m{their}[0m first day off wo n't be for another three weeks . 
(22) [1m[31m{It}[0m is another day for [4m[32m{me}[0m . 
(23) When [4m[32m{I}[0m 'm out here , [4m[32m{I}[0m do n't look at a calendar , [4m[32m{I}[0m do n't think about it . 
(24) [4m[32m{I}[0m stay busy at work . 
(25) Reporter : 
(26) But there are other chances for the SMIP to gather like [4m[31m{this moment of pride to honor sailors who earned a promotion in rank}[0m . 
(27) [4m[31m{It}[0m is called a frocking ceremony . 
(28) There is a sense of respect that you 'll agree as you walk around [1m[35m{this crew}[0m is there . 
(29) As [1m[35m{they}[0m take care of one another the whole community comes together . 
(30) [1m[35m{they}[0m follow together as a team or [1m[35m{they}[0m win together as a team , and I always encourage [1m[35m{them}[0m to take care of [1m[35m{themselves}[0m , because if [1m[35m{they}[0m do n't take care of [1m[35m{themselves}[0m , then it kind of all falls apart at the seams . 
(31) Reporter : 
(32) Last time we saw [3m[36m{this sailor}[0m [3m[36m{he}[0m was washing dishes in the galley . 
(33) Now [3m[36m{he}[0m 's been promoted , and [33m{pilots Sarah `` Clutch '' Joiner and Russ `` Gladys '' Knight}[0m say [33m{their}[0m final good - byes . 
(34) Goggles down , let 's go . 
(35) Reporter : 
(36) Before boarding a cargo flight off [35m{the `` USS Stennis}[0m . '' 
(37) [33m{They}[0m 'll be home in time for [1m[31m{Christmas}[0m . 
(38) [4m[34m{I}[0m 've been here for four and a half years . 
(39) It is probably time to go , but [4m[34m{I}[0m 'm going to miss [31m{them}[0m . 
(40) [31m{They}[0m 're pretty much [4m[34m{my}[0m family right now , or [4m[34m{my}[0m family away from [4m[34m{my}[0m family . 
(41) Reporter : 
(42) Savoring every last minute on [35m{the ship}[0m , [3m[31m{Commander Knight}[0m rushes to the flight only seconds before the door closes . 
(43) Had is [4m[35m{the best tour of my life}[0m . 
(44) 19 years in the Navy , [4m[35m{it}[0m has been the best tour of [3m[31m{my}[0m life . 
(45) Reporter : 
(46) For the rest of [1m[35m{the crew}[0m , there is five more months to go in this deployment , and no one knows how long America 's new war on terrorism will keep [35m{the `` USS John C. Stennis ''}[0m engaged in battle , on highest alert as a carrier at war . 
(47) [34m{We}[0m continue with the pride and professionalism [34m{we}[0m have shown to date , [34m{we}[0m ca n't do anything but be successful . 
(48) Please make sure [3m[33m{you}[0m take care of [3m[33m{your}[0m ship . 
(49) Take care of [3m[33m{yourselves}[0m .
