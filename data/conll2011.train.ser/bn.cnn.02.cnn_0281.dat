(0) Now that Saddam Hussein 's regime has fallen is democracy the answer to [1m[31m{Iraq}[0m and [1m[31m{its}[0m people . 
(1) In [3m[33m{his}[0m book , [3m[33m{Fareed Zakar Ericks A}[0m joins us now to talk about democracy and [1m[31m{Iraq 's}[0m future . 
(2) Good to see [3m[33m{you}[0m . 
(3) Thank [33m{you}[0m , [33m{Paula}[0m . 
(4) Good to see [3m[33m{you}[0m on a different network for a change . 
(5) That 's what happens when you sell books . 
(6) [33m{I}[0m know . 
(7) Let 's talk about what [3m[34m{Barbara Starr}[0m was reporting from the Pentagon . 
(8) [3m[34m{She}[0m says there is an acknowledgment from those officials that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in Baghdad to control what our Nic Robertson is saying is a stage of anarchy in some parts of [1m[31m{Iraq}[0m . 
(9) Do [3m[33m{you}[0m think [1m[32m{the administration}[0m underestimated [1m[34m{the day after}[0m ? 
(10) because [1m[34m{the day after}[0m came so fast and so suddenly in a way , [3m[33m{I}[0m think that there 's been a pattern here not just with [1m[32m{this administration}[0m , but over the last ten years , [35m{Bosnia}[0m , Kosovo , Afghanistan , where we do n't quite recognize when [32m{the old order}[0m collapses , you very quickly have to rush in and fill [32m{it}[0m with some kind of new order . 
(11) In the short term , that 's going to have to mean the American military , but the key question , which [3m[33m{I}[0m try to address in [31m{the book}[0m , is What do you do after that ? What kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition . 
(12) And how do you know that the local Iraqi citizens will make up [34m{this government}[0m or are , in fact , interested in democracy ? 
(13) There 's no proof of that . 
(14) Well , the key here is the only way to get [1m[35m{that kind of legitimate government}[0m to have [1m[35m{it}[0m look good is to hold elections , but if you hold elections , you stop [36m{the whole process of building a rule of law , creating courts , creating administration}[0m . 
(15) We 've seen in the past in [35m{Bosnia for example}[0m , you held elections and [1m[36m{all of the old ethnic thugs}[0m get into power because [1m[36m{they}[0m have organization and [1m[36m{they}[0m have money and [1m[36m{they}[0m stop [36m{the process of genuine building of democracy}[0m . 
(16) There is this tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some way get [3m[31m{legitimate Iraqi authority}[0m , but the faster you get [3m[31m{that}[0m , the more likely you stop [36m{this process}[0m . 
(17) So what do [3m[33m{you}[0m think of [34m{this interim government}[0m ? 
(18) You got Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz saying that American and British military forces would play a leading role in setting up an Iraqi government and then later draw civilians into the process . 
(19) Is [1m[33m{that}[0m going to work ? 
(20) [3m[33m{I}[0m think [1m[33m{it}[0m will work if [1m[33m{it}[0m 's truly broad - based and truly consensual , try and include [3m[32m{all different people}[0m and including [3m[32m{them}[0m in creating a constitution which would take a few years . 
(21) What [3m[33m{I}[0m point out is the places where you 've had quick transitions --
