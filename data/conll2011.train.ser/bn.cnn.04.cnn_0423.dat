(0) Well , also in England , [3m[34m{he}[0m 's rich , handsome , got millions of adoring fans , and [3m[35m{today}[0m [3m[34m{he}[0m celebrates a birthday , big 21 . 
(1) [3m[34m{Prince William , second in line to the British throne .}[0m 
(2) CNN 's Walter Rodgers has the story . 
(3) Reporter : 
(4) In days of yore , [1m[35m{an English prince , a king in waiting}[0m would be charging off to battle on a horse , just before [1m[35m{his}[0m 21st birthday . 
(5) [3m[34m{Prince William}[0m is chasing a polo ball , such of what has become of [4m[32m{the British monarchy}[0m over time . 
(6) Buckingham Palace released his pictures of [3m[34m{William}[0m , brother Harry and [4m[35m{their father , Prince Charles}[0m in what some see as a skilled marketing campaign to sell [4m[32m{the monarchy}[0m to the next generation of Britains . 
(7) After 15 years of scandals and embarrassment , many see [3m[34m{Prince William}[0m as the House of Windsor 's only hope . 
(8) It 's [3m[36m{the young people}[0m [3m[34m{he}[0m needs to appeal to . 
(9) By the time [3m[34m{he}[0m [1m[36m{gets}[0m to [3m[31m{the throne}[0m , [1m[36m{it}[0m 's going to be in 40 years , [3m[36m{the young people of today that need to be his fans}[0m . 
(10) Reporter : 
(11) [3m[34m{William}[0m does not lack for fans . 
(12) [4m[34m{Those who wept when his mother , Princess Diana , died}[0m , apparently transfered [4m[34m{their}[0m affection to [4m[31m{her}[0m eldest son . 
(13) [3m[34m{He}[0m is part teen idol , part king in the making , but unlike [3m[34m{his}[0m father , Prince Charles , who is likely to precede [3m[34m{him}[0m to [3m[31m{the throne}[0m , [3m[34m{this prince}[0m disdains being called your Royal Highness , signing [3m[34m{his}[0m name , William Wales . 
(14) I would think that if you asked anyone if [3m[34m{William}[0m is normal , every single person would say , absolutely normal , but slightly more serious than most young men [3m[34m{his}[0m age . 
(15) Reporter : 
(16) [3m[34m{Prince William}[0m is most at ease with those closest to [3m[34m{him}[0m , those [3m[34m{he}[0m can trust not to run to [4m[33m{Britain 's}[0m gossipy media . 
(17) Despite [4m[35m{Prince Charles '}[0m ugly divorce with [4m[31m{Princess Diana}[0m , the affection between [4m[35m{father}[0m and [3m[34m{son}[0m is now palpable and enviable . 
(18) You 're all very good . 
(19) Reporter : 
(20) [3m[34m{The younger king in the making}[0m calls [4m[33m{Britain 's}[0m next king Pa . 
(21) [3m[34m{William , once his mother 's confidante and protector}[0m now seems the apple of [3m[34m{his}[0m father 's eye . 
(22) Was chasing him with a stick , and the horse was ducking . 
(23) Reporter :
