(0) Why ca n't we teach our children to read , write and reckon ? 
(1) It 's not that we do n't know how to , because we do . 
(2) It 's that we do n't want to . 
(3) And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish [3m[32m{some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular}[0m , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests . 
(4) [3m[32m{These beliefs}[0m so dominate [35m{our educational establishment}[0m , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge [3m[32m{them}[0m . 
(5) Here is an example . 
(6) If [1m[33m{I}[0m were to ask [4m[33m{a sample of American parents}[0m , `` Do [4m[33m{you}[0m wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in [4m[33m{your}[0m children ? '' the near - unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course . '' 
(7) But what do we mean , specifically , by `` [4m[32m{creativity}[0m '' ? 
(8) No one can say . 
(9) In practice , [4m[32m{it}[0m ends up being equated with a `` self - expression '' that encourages the youngsters ' `` self - esteem . '' 
(10) The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves . 
(11) [3m[31m{The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education}[0m was -LRB- and is -RRB- part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was -LRB- and is -RRB- regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children . 
(12) It is not surprising that [1m[34m{parents}[0m find [3m[31m{this romantic extravagance}[0m so attractive . 
(13) Fortunately , [1m[34m{these same parents}[0m do want [1m[34m{their}[0m children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and [1m[34m{they}[0m have [34m{enough common sense to know what that demands}[0m . 
(14) [1m[34m{Their}[0m commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy . 
(15) American education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow [34m{this common sense}[0m to prevail over the illusions that we also share . 
(16) [35m{The education establishment}[0m will fight against common sense every inch of the way . 
(17) The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated . 
(18) [3m[32m{`` Progressive education '' -LRB- as it was once called -RRB-}[0m is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction . 
(19) It is nice for [4m[36m{teachers}[0m to think [4m[36m{they}[0m are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results . 
(20) [3m[32m{It}[0m also provides [3m[34m{teachers}[0m with a superior self - definition as a `` profession , '' since [3m[34m{they}[0m will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy . 
(21) [1m[33m{I myself}[0m took [4m[34m{such courses}[0m in college , thinking [1m[33m{I}[0m might end up a schoolteacher . 
(22) [4m[34m{They}[0m could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses . 
(23) But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from [35m{the educational establishment}[0m . 
(24) [1m[33m{I}[0m know [3m[34m{many schoolteachers}[0m and , on the whole , [3m[34m{they}[0m are seriously committed to conscientious teaching . 
(25) [3m[34m{They}[0m may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of [3m[34m{their}[0m generation -- there are very few such people , by definition . 
(26) But [3m[34m{they}[0m need not be to do [3m[34m{their}[0m jobs well . 
(27) Yes , [3m[36m{we all}[0m can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from [3m[36m{our}[0m school days . 
(28) But [3m[36m{our}[0m education [1m[35m{proceeded}[0m at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious . 
(29) In [1m[35m{this sense}[0m , a teacher can be compared to [32m{one 's family doctor}[0m . 
(30) If [32m{he}[0m were brilliant , [32m{he}[0m probably would not be a family doctor in the first place . 
(31) If [32m{he}[0m is competent and conscientious , [32m{he}[0m serves us well . 
(32) [4m[35m{Our teachers}[0m are not an important factor in our educational crisis . 
(33) Whether [4m[35m{they}[0m are or are not underpaid is [1m[31m{a problem of equity}[0m ; [1m[31m{it}[0m is not an educational problem . 
(34) It is [4m[33m{silly libel on our teachers}[0m to think [36m{they}[0m would educate our children better if only [36m{they}[0m got a few thousand dollars a year more . 
(35) [4m[33m{It}[0m is the kind of libel [34m{the teachers ' unions}[0m do n't mind spreading , for [34m{their}[0m own narrow purposes . 
(36) [4m[33m{It}[0m is also the kind of libel [3m[33m{politicians}[0m find useful , since [4m[33m{it}[0m helps [3m[33m{them}[0m strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency . 
(37) But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials . 
(38) If there were [1m[32m{such evidence}[0m , you can be sure you would have heard of [1m[32m{it}[0m . 
(39) If we wish to be serious about American education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do . 
(40) There are [33m{many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos}[0m , and [33m{they}[0m are all sending us the same message . 
(41) Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand . 
(42) We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking . 
(43) In this respect , it would be helpful if [33m{our political leaders}[0m were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned . '' 
(44) [33m{They}[0m are inevitably inclined to [36m{echo}[0m the conventional pap , since [36m{this}[0m is the least controversial option that is open to [33m{them}[0m . 
(45) Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , [4m[36m{Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas}[0m announced that `` [4m[35m{this country}[0m needs a comprehensive child - development policy for children under five . '' 
(46) A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need . 
(47) What [4m[36m{Gov. Clinton}[0m is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years . 
(48) Whether desirable or not , this is a child - care program , not an educational program . 
(49) We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away . 
(50) Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea . 
(51) [32m{Parents}[0m are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of [32m{their}[0m children . 
(52) [3m[36m{Parents}[0m should be involved with [3m[36m{their}[0m children 's education at home , not in school . 
(53) [3m[36m{They}[0m should see to it that [3m[36m{their}[0m kids do n't play truant ; [3m[36m{they}[0m should make certain that [3m[33m{the children}[0m spend enough time doing homework ; [3m[36m{they}[0m should scrutinize the report card . 
(54) If [31m{parents}[0m are dissatisfied with a school , [31m{they}[0m should have the option of switching to another . 
(55) -- `` Community involvement '' is an even worse idea . 
(56) Here , the experience of [35m{New York City}[0m is decisive . 
(57) Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would - be politicians . 
(58) [35m{New York}[0m is in the process of trying to disengage [35m{itself}[0m from a 20 - year - old commitment to [4m[31m{this system of school governance}[0m , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute [4m[31m{it}[0m . 
(59) -- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better . 
(60) The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal . 
(61) Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that [31m{even smaller classes}[0m have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though [31m{they}[0m may sometimes be desirable for other reasons . 
(62) The new money flows into the already top - heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers . 
(63) There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures -LRB- in real terms -RRB- have increased sharply in the past quarter - of - a - century -- [4m[35m{we}[0m now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined . 
(64) That is the way the system works . 
(65) -- [3m[35m{Students}[0m should move up the educational ladder as [3m[35m{their}[0m academic potential allows . 
(66) No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago . 
(67) This means `` tracking , '' whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish -LRB- though that is clearly desirable -RRB- than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work . 
(68) The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic '' is absurd . 
(69) The purpose of education is to encourage [1m[36m{young men and women}[0m to realize [1m[36m{their}[0m full academic potential . 
(70) No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential . 
(71) -- It is generally desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them , alas , out of print -- rather than [4m[34m{newer ones}[0m . 
(72) [4m[34m{The latter}[0m are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial . 
(73) [4m[34m{They}[0m are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience . 
(74) One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods . 
(75) Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who ca n't add or subtract `` learning '' the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by Caleb Nelson -LRB- himself a recent math major at Harvard -RRB- in the November American Spectator . 
(76) -- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline . 
(77) Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are [4m[31m{those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head}[0m . 
(78) With [3m[35m{that authority}[0m , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability . 
(79) [4m[31m{Schools that are structured in this way}[0m [4m[32m{produce}[0m students with higher morale and superior academic performance . 
(80) [4m[32m{This}[0m is a fact -- though , in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by [4m[32m{this fact}[0m , it is not surprising that one hears so little about [4m[32m{it}[0m . 
(81) [1m[33m{Mr. Kristol , an American Enterprise Institute fellow ,}[0m co-edits The Public Interest and publishes The National Interest .
