(0) I 'm David Coler , VOA News . 
(1) Three [3m[36m{Florida}[0m courts are weighing cases that could signally end in the month - long battle for the White House . 
(2) Decisions were expected swiftly with [1m[32m{the December 12th deadline for Florida to certify its 25 electors , the people who will actually choose the next US President}[0m . 
(3) Thursday , lawyers for [1m[31m{Vice President Al Gore}[0m and [3m[35m{Texas Governor George W Bush}[0m were subjected to intense grilling in a [3m[31m{Florida Supreme Court}[0m hearing on [1m[31m{the Democratic candidate 's}[0m appeal of the rejection of [1m[31m{his}[0m request for a recount . 
(4) [1m[31m{His}[0m chief lawyer David Boyz says whatever [3m[31m{the court}[0m decides , [3m[36m{the state 's}[0m deadline will be met . 
(5) [3m[32m{I}[0m think that what [1m[33m{they}[0m have consistently said is that [1m[33m{they}[0m expect [1m[35m{this}[0m to be over by [4m[31m{December 12th}[0m . 
(6) [1m[34m{We}[0m believe [1m[35m{it}[0m can be over by [4m[31m{December 12th}[0m , and if [1m[33m{they}[0m come out with an order that says [1m[33m{we}[0m are not going to count any ballots , that 's going to resolve by [4m[31m{December 12th}[0m . 
(7) If [1m[33m{they}[0m come out with an order that says [1m[33m{we}[0m are going to count the ballots , [1m[33m{we}[0m 're going to start now , [1m[34m{we}[0m believe that can be resolved by [4m[31m{December 12th}[0m . 
(8) At the same time , [3m[34m{the Bush legal team}[0m made [3m[34m{its}[0m final arguments in [3m[33m{a challenge by Democratic voters who want thousands of absentee ballots thrown out}[0m . 
(9) If [3m[33m{the challenge}[0m [1m[36m{succeeds}[0m , [1m[36m{it}[0m could more than reverse [3m[35m{the Texas Governor 's}[0m 537 - vote lead .
