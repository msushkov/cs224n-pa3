(0) [31m{George W. Bush}[0m is campaigning in [4m[33m{the hotly contested Sunshine State}[0m [4m[35m{today}[0m . 
(1) [31m{Bush}[0m is stumping with [31m{his}[0m brother Jeb , who is governor of [4m[33m{the state}[0m . 
(2) Also on hand , Arizona Senator John M Cain . 
(3) Meanwhile , [32m{Gore}[0m is expected to deliver what aides are calling a major speech on education in [4m[31m{Tennessee}[0m this morning . 
(4) [32m{The Vice President}[0m is campaigning with running mate Joe Lieberman . 
(5) Polls in [32m{Gore 's}[0m home state show [32m{him}[0m nearly even with [31m{Bush}[0m . 
(6) Nationwide , the race appears to be seesawing back and forth . 
(7) We have not seen the lead change hands , after [4m[34m{Labor Day}[0m , according to the Gallup Poll , in a presidential election since 1980 . 
(8) This is the first time . 
(9) In 1984 , 1988 , 1992 and 1996 , the candidate who was ahead on [4m[34m{Labor Day}[0m never went behind . 
(10) Now , unless I 've lost track , because it 's been a little hard to keep track , [4m[35m{today}[0m is the fifth lead change in [3m[36m{Gallup}[0m polling after Labor Day between [32m{Gore}[0m and [31m{Bush}[0m . 
(11) The lead did [4m[36m{change}[0m hands . 
(12) [4m[32m{Yesterday 's CNN / `` USA Today '' / Gallup tracking poll}[0m shows [32m{Gore}[0m with a slight edge for the first time in two weeks . 
(13) [4m[32m{The new numbers}[0m show that if the election were held [4m[35m{today}[0m , 46 % of the likely voters questioned would choose [32m{Gore}[0m . 
(14) 45 % would choose [31m{Bush}[0m , but the pollsters say [4m[36m{the change}[0m is statistically insignificant when the margin of error is considered .
