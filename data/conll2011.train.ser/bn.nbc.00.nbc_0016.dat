(0) Good evening . 
(1) There is n't a national poll in [1m[31m{the race between Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush}[0m that shows a clear advantage for one or the other with two weekends to go . 
(2) According to [4m[32m{today 's}[0m MSNBC / Reuters tracking poll , [3m[33m{Gore}[0m is hanging onto a two - point lead over [3m[32m{Bush}[0m for the second day in a row , but [35m{all these polls}[0m , it 's important to point out , are within a margin of error that could flip the results . 
(3) What [35m{they}[0m 're really telling us is that [1m[31m{the race}[0m appears to be a dead heat , and with time running short , the final strategies are taking a sharper form . 
(4) [3m[35m{NBC 's}[0m David Gregory is with [3m[32m{the governor}[0m again [31m{tonight}[0m , [4m[35m{Claire Shipman}[0m with [3m[33m{the Vice President}[0m . 
(5) [4m[35m{Claire}[0m , the [3m[33m{Gore}[0m campaign worried about [36m{Ralph Nader}[0m . 
(6) [32m{Tom}[0m , the greening of [3m[33m{Al Gore}[0m [4m[32m{today}[0m -- 
(7) [3m[33m{His}[0m environmental message has n't always been a priority on the campaign trail , but now , with fears of [36m{Ralph Nader 's}[0m growing support , [1m[36m{it}[0m could be critical . 
(8) [3m[33m{Al Gore , today hopscotching across the Midwest , reminding voters of his environmentalist credentials .}[0m 
(9) Together , we can clean up the environment . 
(10) Seizing on a new U.N. report about [1m[34m{global warming}[0m , [3m[33m{he}[0m pitches [3m[33m{his}[0m message in diners . 
(11) One that [3m[33m{I}[0m 've worked on a lot , one people do n't talk about , is [1m[34m{global warming}[0m . 
(12) And even to TV personality Queen Latifah . 
(13) The environment is at stake in [4m[34m{this election}[0m . 
(14) Why ? 
(15) [1m[36m{It}[0m 's a message that appeals to those critical undecided voters and especially [3m[34m{the supporters of this man , Ralph Nader}[0m . 
(16) Once a minor distraction , [3m[33m{Gore}[0m aides now fear [36m{Nader}[0m could cost them [4m[34m{the election}[0m . 
(17) How much can [36m{Nader}[0m hurt ? 
(18) Take [33m{Oregon , a state Gore was counting on}[0m . 
(19) A recent poll has [3m[32m{Bush}[0m at 45 % , [3m[33m{Gore}[0m at 41 % and [36m{Nader}[0m at 10 % . 
(20) In [1m[33m{traditionally Democratic Minnesota}[0m , [3m[32m{Bush}[0m has 44 % , [3m[33m{Gore}[0m 41 % , [36m{Nader}[0m 8 % . 
(21) Here in Wisconsin , [3m[33m{Gore}[0m has an edge in one poll , [3m[32m{Bush}[0m in another . 
(22) [36m{Nader}[0m remains steady at 5 % . 
(23) Those statistics have Democrats cranking up the heat on [36m{Nader}[0m supporters . 
(24) Former [3m[33m{Gore}[0m rival Bill Bradley , on the stump [4m[32m{today}[0m in Washington State . 
(25) Pro-choice organizations are spending big money for ads like this one to make the case that a vote for [36m{Nader}[0m could mean the end of a woman 's right to choose . 
(26) Before voting [36m{Nader}[0m , consider the risk . 
(27) It 's your choice . 
(28) Environmental groups are also getting involved . 
(29) Some prominent Democrats are thinking about a full - page ad in `` the New York Times , '' and look for states like [33m{Oregon}[0m and [1m[33m{Minnesota}[0m to figure prominently on [3m[33m{Gore 's}[0m travel schedule in the final week . 
(30) [32m{Tom ?}[0m 
(31) Thanks very much , [3m[35m{NBC 's}[0m Claire Shipman [31m{tonight}[0m . 
(32) As for [3m[32m{Governor Bush}[0m , [3m[32m{he}[0m had some high - powered help [4m[32m{today}[0m on the campaign trail and a more pointed commentary on [3m[33m{the Vice President}[0m . 
(33) [3m[35m{NBC 's}[0m David Gregory with [3m[33m{the Vice President}[0m in Pittsburgh [31m{tonight}[0m . 
(34) [32m{Tom}[0m , making it abundantly clear that the [3m[31m{Clinton / Gore}[0m scandals of the past eight years will be a major theme in the closing days of this campaign , [3m[32m{Bush}[0m attacks [3m[33m{the Vice President}[0m for being a failed leader and promises if [3m[32m{he}[0m 's elected [4m[36m{Americans}[0m will once again be able to respect [4m[36m{their}[0m government . 
(35) [3m[32m{Bush}[0m campaigns [4m[32m{today}[0m in this tough battleground state alongside [4m[33m{the popular retired general Colin Powell}[0m and again hints strongly [4m[33m{Powell}[0m will be a member of [3m[32m{his}[0m cabinet if elected . 
(36) [4m[32m{Today 's}[0m address focuses on `` responsible leadership '' and how on issues like Social Security and Medicare , [3m[31m{the Clinton / Gore administration}[0m has failed to pr . 
(37) [3m[31m{They}[0m are going out as [3m[31m{they}[0m came in -- [3m[31m{their}[0m guide , [1m[35m{the nightly polls}[0m , [3m[31m{their}[0m goal , [34m{the morning headlines}[0m , [3m[31m{their}[0m legacy , [3m[36m{the fruitless search for a legacy}[0m . 
(38) With [1m[31m{the race}[0m so tight , advisers are hunkered down trying to for [4m[31m{the final push}[0m , plotting out [4m[31m{the final push that , aides say , is likely to include visits to eight different states Bill Clinton carried the last two elections}[0m . 
(39) [32m{Tom ?}[0m 
(40) [1m[32m{David Gregory}[0m [31m{tonight}[0m with [3m[32m{Governor Bush}[0m , not with [3m[33m{Vice President Gore}[0m , obviously .
