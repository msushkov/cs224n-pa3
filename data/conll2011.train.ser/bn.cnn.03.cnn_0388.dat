(0) We now return to `` People in the News . '' 
(1) Reporter : 
(2) For [4m[35m{Martha Stewart}[0m seems business is everything , and everywhere . 
(3) [4m[35m{Stewart}[0m has found the road to fortune wherever [4m[35m{she}[0m has traveled . 
(4) I think the temptation for any successful entrepreneur to go global . 
(5) Reporter : 
(6) [4m[35m{Her}[0m marketing vision also included [4m[33m{KMart a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy}[0m . 
(7) Okay , girls . 
(8) Reporter : 
(9) [4m[35m{Stewart}[0m is associated with [4m[33m{Kmart}[0m since 1987 and been very successful . 
(10) The goal had been to bring affordable style to the masse . 
(11) There 's a reason [4m[35m{she}[0m was successful , and [33m{the stuff that she 's created}[0m people like . 
(12) [33m{It}[0m 's good , [33m{it}[0m 's useful , [33m{it}[0m 's appealing , [33m{it}[0m 's attractive and [33m{it}[0m 's cheap . 
(13) Reporter : 
(14) Even as [4m[33m{Kmart}[0m struggled through financial difficulties , [4m[35m{Stewart}[0m stuck by [4m[33m{the company}[0m . 
(15) It 's hard to [31m{run}[0m out on a partner that 's down . 
(16) [31m{That}[0m 's not our style . 
(17) Reporter : 
(18) Now [4m[35m{Stewart}[0m is hoping people do n't run out on [4m[35m{her}[0m . 
(19) [4m[35m{The celebrity}[0m indicted on [1m[35m{charges stemming from the sale of ImClone stock}[0m . 
(20) [4m[35m{Stewart}[0m and former [4m[34m{ImClone}[0m CEO Sam Waksal shared [3m[31m{a broker who now also faces charges of obstruction of justice and perjury}[0m . 
(21) [4m[35m{Her}[0m defense has been that [4m[35m{she}[0m had a standing sell order at $ 60 and when [1m[32m{the stock}[0m fell below 60 [3m[31m{the broker}[0m was supposed to , you know make the trade . 
(22) [4m[35m{She}[0m 's been standing with [35m{that story}[0m . 
(23) [3m[31m{The broker}[0m standing by [35m{that story}[0m . 
(24) The only reason [35m{it}[0m 's not holding is because there are other people that the Merrill Lynch that investigated and did n't find proof [35m{that}[0m was actually the case . 
(25) Reporter : 
(26) After [4m[35m{Stewart}[0m was charged by federal authorities Wednesday , [4m[35m{her}[0m lawyers issued a statement in which [32m{they}[0m said , quote , [4m[35m{Martha Stewart}[0m has done nothing wrong . 
(27) The accusation that [4m[35m{Martha Stewart}[0m [1m[31m{sold}[0m [1m[32m{the ImClone shares}[0m based on inside information proved to be false . 
(28) If [4m[35m{she}[0m lied , then [4m[36m{that}[0m is the obstruction of justice charge . 
(29) [4m[36m{That}[0m 's the criminal side . 
(30) [4m[36m{That}[0m 's where the prison time comes in . 
(31) Reporter : 
(32) For [4m[35m{Stewart}[0m , the fallout from the past year taken a tremendous toll . 
(33) [4m[35m{Martha Stewart}[0m told me that [36m{the investigation itself}[0m had cost [4m[35m{her}[0m about $ 400 million , in decline in [4m[35m{her}[0m stock , legal fees , and lost business opportunities . 
(34) Reporter : 
(35) Ironic , considering [1m[31m{the sale of the ImClone stock}[0m resulted in a gain of less than $ 50,000 . 
(36) [4m[35m{She}[0m 'll never fully recover . 
(37) You know , it 's almost like e.g. you get off [1m[36m{the hook}[0m , but are you really off the [1m[36m{hook}[0m because people always believe you were guilty . 
(38) And it 's hard to win back that sort of brand equity that [4m[35m{she}[0m 's lost . 
(39) Reporter : 
(40) [4m[35m{Stewart}[0m is vowing to clear [4m[35m{her}[0m name of [1m[35m{the charges}[0m . 
(41) [4m[35m{She}[0m is so focused and so determined that [36m{this investigation}[0m , while terribly upsetting , has not been something that 's stood in [4m[35m{her}[0m way . 
(42) As [4m[35m{only she}[0m would , [4m[35m{she}[0m said , Look , [4m[35m{I}[0m do n't lose any sleep . 
(43) [4m[35m{I}[0m still sleep [4m[35m{my}[0m three or four hours a night . 
(44) Reporter : 
(45) [34m{He}[0m says [4m[35m{Stewart}[0m is still taken aback by the reaction to [4m[35m{her}[0m legal troubles . 
(46) [34m{I}[0m think [4m[35m{she}[0m 's been stunned at how much joy so many people have taken at [4m[35m{her}[0m misfortune . 
(47) [4m[35m{She}[0m does n't quite understand that the perfectionism that made [4m[35m{her}[0m so famous also makes people say , Oh , is n't it fun to see someone like that have a big , big problem ? 
(48) Reporter : 
(49) A perfectionism reflected in even the smallest details of [4m[35m{Stewart 's}[0m life . 
(50) [4m[35m{Martha}[0m does n't like to talk about how unpleasant things have [1m[34m{been}[0m , but you can get signals of [1m[34m{it}[0m in surprising ways . 
(51) When we sat down to lunch , [4m[35m{she}[0m had put out these beautiful chop sticks which I commented on . 
(52) [4m[35m{She}[0m said , in China , the person with the thinnest chop sticks has the highest social status , and of course , [4m[35m{I}[0m [1m[33m{had}[0m to get the thinnest chop sticks . 
(53) Then [4m[35m{she}[0m paused and said , [1m[33m{That}[0m 's why people hate [4m[35m{me}[0m . 
(54) Reporter : 
(55) Love [4m[35m{her}[0m or hate [4m[35m{her}[0m , [4m[35m{Martha Stewart}[0m has tied every aspect of [4m[35m{her}[0m image to [4m[35m{her}[0m business . 
(56) Even [4m[35m{her}[0m daily calendar turned into a marketing tool . 
(57) [4m[35m{She}[0m said to me once that [4m[35m{my}[0m life is `` The Truman Show '' and meant [4m[35m{I}[0m 'm always on . 
(58) From the time [4m[35m{I}[0m get up until [4m[35m{I}[0m go to bed , the whole world is watching . 
(59) Hello , everyone .
