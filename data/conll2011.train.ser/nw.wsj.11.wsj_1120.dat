(0) [4m[36m{Japan}[0m has [3m[32m{climbed}[0m up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $ 800 per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations . 
(1) Now [3m[32m{this remarkable economic growth}[0m seems to be coming to an end because [3m[33m{the government}[0m has not converted [3m[33m{itself}[0m into a modern , democratic , `` developed nation '' mode of operation . 
(2) Until 1980 , when [4m[36m{Japan}[0m joined the $ 10,000 per capita GNP club of the advanced countries , [4m[36m{it}[0m was a model developing nation . 
(3) [3m[33m{The government}[0m built ports , bridges , highways , schools , hospitals and railways . 
(4) When [3m[36m{industries}[0m were weak , [3m[33m{it}[0m protected [3m[36m{them}[0m . 
(5) [3m[33m{It}[0m gave [4m[36m{the Japanese people}[0m [32m{a value system , based on the rationalization that given the country 's lack of natural resources , they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus}[0m . 
(6) Individual prosperity inevitably would result . 
(7) [32m{That system}[0m has worked . 
(8) The standard of living has increased steadily over [4m[31m{the past 40 years}[0m ; [1m[34m{more than 90 % of the people}[0m consider [1m[34m{themselves}[0m middle class . 
(9) [4m[36m{The people}[0m have given [4m[34m{their leading and only credible political party , the Liberal Democratic Party ,}[0m clear and uninterrupted power for [4m[31m{those 40 years}[0m . 
(10) [4m[34m{The LDP}[0m won by a landslide in the last election , in July 1986 . 
(11) But less than two years later , [4m[34m{the LDP}[0m started to crumble , and dissent rose to unprecedented heights . 
(12) The symptoms all point to one thing : [4m[36m{Japan}[0m does not have a modern government . 
(13) [4m[36m{Its}[0m government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brakes and steer , with 120 million people in the back seat . 
(14) In a modern system , [33m{the government 's}[0m role is to give [31m{the people}[0m as much choice as possible and to keep [31m{them}[0m well informed so [31m{they}[0m are capable of making a choice . 
(15) [33m{It}[0m also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in [35m{the world}[0m . 
(16) [3m[33m{The Japanese government}[0m does n't allow this . 
(17) The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions . 
(18) The Ministry of Health and Welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of [4m[36m{the people}[0m . 
(19) The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers , and certainly does not act on behalf of students . 
(20) [36m{The Ministry of Construction}[0m spreads concrete throughout [4m[36m{the country}[0m and boasts in international conferences that [4m[36m{Japan 's}[0m paved roadway per capita is the longest in [35m{the world}[0m , but [36m{they}[0m seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic . 
(21) The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry , certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices . 
(22) And [36m{the Ministry of Foreign Affairs}[0m works for [36m{itself}[0m , supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around [35m{the world}[0m to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's . 
(23) [36m{This ministry}[0m has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of [4m[36m{Japan 's}[0m deteriorating image . 
(24) Instead , [36m{it}[0m seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand [36m{its}[0m sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries . 
(25) All this illustrates that [1m[33m{Japanese ministries}[0m still have a `` provider '' mentality ; [1m[33m{they}[0m do not serve [4m[36m{the people}[0m , and particularly not consumers . 
(26) [1m[33m{They}[0m serve the industries and the special - interest groups . 
(27) The rest of [35m{the world}[0m accepted [4m[35m{such methods}[0m when [4m[36m{Japan}[0m was developing . 
(28) Japanese put up with [4m[35m{it}[0m because [3m[33m{the government}[0m provided job stability and growing paychecks . 
(29) [4m[36m{Japan}[0m is not a political country . 
(30) [4m[36m{It}[0m is a bureaucratic country . 
(31) [3m[34m{The Diet}[0m plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system . 
(32) Most bills are drafted by bureaucrats , not politicians . 
(33) [3m[34m{The Diet}[0m does n't normally even [3m[31m{debate}[0m bills because [3m[35m{the opposition parties}[0m are so often opposed to whatever [4m[34m{LDP}[0m does that [3m[31m{it}[0m would be a waste of time . 
(34) So most bills are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of [3m[35m{the opposition parties}[0m . 
(35) A recent example is [34m{the 3 % consumption tax on all commercial activities}[0m . 
(36) [34m{This}[0m makes enormous sense in [4m[36m{Japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair}[0m . 
(37) If you are a salaried man , Amen ! 100 % captured . 
(38) If you are a retailer , 50 % , and a farmer , 30 % . 
(39) To correct this inequality , most people would have favored an indirect tax , like [34m{the consumption tax}[0m . 
(40) But the bill was passed without debate in [3m[34m{the Diet}[0m , in the absence of the opposition . 
(41) As a result , [4m[36m{the Japanese people}[0m did n't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on April 1 . 
(42) [4m[36m{They}[0m were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change . 
(43) All of a sudden , [1m[36m{prices}[0m were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200 . 
(44) [1m[36m{They}[0m were 103 or 206 . 
(45) Pockets exploded with one - yen coins . 
(46) While [1m[35m{people}[0m were jingling [1m[35m{their}[0m change , the [4m[34m{LDP}[0m politicians were caught in scandals . 
(47) Money , such as in [1m[31m{Recruit 's}[0m political donations , and women , as in the cases of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita , seldom have caused political scandals in [4m[36m{Japan}[0m . 
(48) Whereas [4m[32m{most men}[0m were a bit ambivalent about [1m[32m{the sex scandals}[0m -LRB- though [4m[32m{they}[0m were furious about [1m[31m{Recruit}[0m -RRB- , women were upset about both and surged to the polls . 
(49) In the recent Upper House and Tokyo metropolitan congressional elections , in which [4m[33m{the Socialist Party}[0m won a runaway victory , [3m[36m{60 % of all women}[0m voted , as opposed to the usual 40 % . 
(50) It is difficult to analyze how much of [3m[36m{their}[0m anger was due to [1m[31m{Recruit}[0m , [1m[32m{the sex scandals}[0m , or the one - yen coins in [3m[36m{their}[0m purses , but [3m[36m{they}[0m obviously were voting to punish [4m[34m{the LDP}[0m . 
(51) Taken by surprise , [4m[33m{the Socialist Party}[0m is busy changing [4m[33m{its}[0m doctrines . 
(52) It 's now OK to deal with the U.S. , but not the Soviet Union . 
(53) Nuclear power plants are acceptable . 
(54) The [4m[36m{U.S. - Japan}[0m Security Treaty can continue , sort of . 
(55) And so on . 
(56) Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of [4m[33m{the Socialist Party}[0m [4m[34m{the LDP}[0m has been paralyzed . 
(57) Now is the time to reform [3m[33m{the government}[0m from a provider , developing - country vanguard role to that of a modern , industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice . 
(58) If [4m[34m{the LDP , as currently composed ,}[0m ca n't make the transformation , then [4m[34m{it}[0m should split into two parties . 
(59) One party could stand for consumer interests , small government , free trade and globalism to put [4m[36m{Japan}[0m clearly among the most developed and open countries . 
(60) The other party could continue on the traditional track of [4m[34m{the LDP}[0m , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism . 
(61) [4m[34m{The LDP}[0m must make a decision immediately ; Lower House elections must take place before June . 
(62) In the current mood of the Japanese people , journalists and even some industrialists , giving power to [4m[33m{the Socialists}[0m might be good for [4m[34m{the LDP}[0m , cleansing [4m[34m{it}[0m of past sins . 
(63) We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real - estate and financial markets . 
(64) At the most there is only nine months before the [4m[34m{LDP}[0m fuse burns out . 
(65) Mr. Ohmae is managing director of McKinsey & Co. in [4m[36m{Japan}[0m .
