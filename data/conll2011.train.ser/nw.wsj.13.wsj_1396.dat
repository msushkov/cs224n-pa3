(0) [4m[36m{The Senate}[0m [33m{convicted}[0m [4m[33m{U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida}[0m of eight impeachment articles , removing [4m[33m{the 53 - year - old judge}[0m from [4m[33m{his}[0m $ 89,500 - a - year , lifetime job . 
(1) [4m[33m{Mr. Hastings 's}[0m case was particularly nettlesome because [32m{it}[0m marked the first time [4m[32m{a federal official}[0m was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted [4m[32m{him}[0m . 
(2) In 1983 , [4m[33m{Mr. Hastings}[0m was found not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before [4m[33m{him}[0m , the central charge on which [4m[36m{the Senate}[0m convicted [4m[33m{him}[0m . 
(3) [4m[33m{He}[0m was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . 
(4) With no floor debate , [4m[36m{the Senate}[0m on Friday voted 69 - 26 to convict [4m[33m{Mr. Hastings}[0m of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed . 
(5) Conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove [4m[33m{Judge Hastings}[0m from office . 
(6) [4m[33m{He}[0m was found not guilty of three charges , involving accusations that [4m[33m{he}[0m had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation . 
(7) [4m[36m{The Senate}[0m did n't vote on six lesser charges . 
(8) Although [4m[33m{Mr. Hastings}[0m had been acquitted by a jury , [4m[34m{lawmakers handling the prosecution in Congress}[0m had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual . 
(9) Instead , [4m[34m{they}[0m argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust , irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases . 
(10) [4m[33m{Mr. Hastings}[0m faced [4m[36m{the senators}[0m and sat impassively during the first two roll - call votes , then quickly left the chamber . 
(11) In an impromptu news conference on the Capitol steps , [4m[33m{he}[0m denounced [4m[36m{the senators '}[0m action . 
(12) `` [4m[36m{Their}[0m opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers ' teaching regarding impeachment , '' [4m[33m{Mr. Hastings}[0m said . 
(13) For the future , [4m[33m{he}[0m said [4m[33m{he}[0m would run for governor of [4m[35m{Florida}[0m . 
(14) [4m[33m{Mr. Hastings}[0m was appointed to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country . 
(15) While [4m[33m{he}[0m packed the [4m[36m{Senate}[0m gallery with [4m[33m{his}[0m supporters during some of the impeachment trial , [31m{most civil rights groups}[0m kept [31m{their}[0m distance from [4m[33m{his}[0m case . 
(16) Following [33m{the impeachment conviction}[0m , Dr. Benjamin Hooks , executive director of [34m{the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People}[0m , issued a restrained statement , warning that [32m{the Hastings case}[0m could set a `` dangerous precedent , '' but adding , `` [34m{We}[0m must respect the considered judgment of [4m[36m{the Senate}[0m .
