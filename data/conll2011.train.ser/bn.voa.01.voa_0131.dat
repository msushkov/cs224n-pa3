(0) Welcome to this hour of VOA News Now . 
(1) I 'm Erin Brumett in Washington . 
(2) The incredibly close [4m[34m{Florida}[0m vote count for President is in [4m[32m{the state courts}[0m and [4m[35m{heading}[0m for [31m{the US Supreme Court}[0m at the end of the week . 
(3) [4m[35m{That}[0m 's virtually unprecedented , as [1m[31m{the federal courts}[0m have tended to stay out of elections , which are the responsibility of the states . 
(4) [1m[35m{Joe O'Grossman}[0m is a professor of constitutional law at [33m{Baltimore 's Johns Hopkins University}[0m . 
(5) [1m[35m{He}[0m says that in this instance [31m{the Supreme Court}[0m probably felt the circumstances were such that [31m{they}[0m had no real alternative but to take [4m[33m{the case}[0m . 
(6) Well , [1m[35m{I}[0m think [31m{they}[0m took [4m[33m{the case}[0m because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for [31m{them}[0m to try to reject [4m[33m{it}[0m out of hand . 
(7) In fact , [1m[35m{I}[0m think that Lawrence Tribe , the Harvard Law School professor who is arguing for [3m[32m{Gore}[0m tomorrow , is going to ask [31m{the court}[0m to hold [4m[33m{the case}[0m , moot and dismiss [4m[33m{it}[0m . 
(8) And [3m[31m{the Bush campaign}[0m has brought [4m[33m{the case}[0m , but recognizes that the particular issues that [3m[31m{they}[0m brought to [31m{the court}[0m [35m{last week}[0m are really not very relevant anymore . 
(9) , well , [1m[35m{I}[0m know what [3m[31m{they}[0m are going to do . 
(10) [3m[31m{They}[0m are going to try to broaden the [4m[33m{case}[0m to make [4m[33m{it}[0m a kind of a general referendum on election procedures . 
(11) So , [3m[31m{they}[0m are looking for a coronation , and [1m[36m{the Gore people}[0m at this point just want to get rid of [4m[33m{this case}[0m , because [1m[36m{they}[0m think [1m[36m{they}[0m have a better chance in [4m[32m{the Florida courts}[0m . 
(12) Republicans generally support states ' rights . 
(13) So , does it appear somewhat ironic that they are going to [31m{the Supreme Court}[0m in this instance ? 
(14) No , [1m[35m{I}[0m think first of all [3m[33m{the notion that Republicans favor states ' rights and Democrats oppose it}[0m , is much too simplistic . 
(15) [3m[33m{That}[0m 's generally true , but [3m[33m{it}[0m 's only true on some issues , and in this case , you could argue that [3m[31m{the Bush people}[0m are going to [31m{the Supreme Court}[0m to preserve [4m[36m{the right of Florida , to determine its own electors}[0m . 
(16) So , there is a kind of states ' rights issue there , but [3m[31m{they}[0m need , or at least [3m[31m{they}[0m once thought [3m[31m{they}[0m needed [31m{the Supreme Court}[0m to endorse [4m[36m{it}[0m . 
(17) So it goes both ways . 
(18) What are [32m{the justices}[0m likely looking for ? 
(19) Well , [1m[35m{I}[0m do n't know . 
(20) and [1m[35m{I}[0m think [32m{they}[0m will be divided , [1m[35m{I}[0m mean [1m[35m{I}[0m do n't think [32m{they}[0m will be unanimous . 
(21) Obviously , [32m{they}[0m would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of [4m[33m{the case}[0m . 
(22) American election laws are often challenged at the local level and sometimes in [1m[31m{the federal courts}[0m , but this is certainly the first time we have had a [31m{Supreme Court}[0m challenge over presidential election . 
(23) So , there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least law that has n't been made yet . 
(24) It 's possible that if [31m{the court}[0m accepts [3m[36m{the invitation of the Bush campaign , at least as it is expressed in the briefs they submitted yesterday}[0m , that [31m{the court}[0m will in the sense , take the entire issue , even - not just the specific questions that [31m{it}[0m was asked [35m{last week}[0m and try to resolve the question . 
(25) For example , if [31m{the court}[0m [34m{says}[0m it is clearly the fact that [1m[32m{the legislature of the state of Florida}[0m can [1m[33m{determine}[0m for [1m[32m{itself}[0m who [1m[32m{its}[0m electors will be , [34m{that}[0m will pretty much end [4m[33m{the case}[0m , because [1m[33m{that}[0m 's what [1m[32m{the legislature}[0m already plans to do , and that does n't mean [1m[36m{the Gore people}[0m wo n't keep trying , because ultimately [3m[34m{Congress}[0m has to decide and [3m[34m{only Congress}[0m can decide if there are competing slates of electors submitted , which slate to accept . 
(26) [1m[35m{The Johns Hopkins University constitutional law professor Joe O'Grossman}[0m says , it 's still not certain [31m{the Supreme Court}[0m will actually hear [4m[33m{the Florida case}[0m . 
(27) As [36m{their}[0m first order , of business Friday , [36m{attorneys for Vice President Gore}[0m will move to have [31m{the court}[0m dismiss [4m[33m{the case brought by Republican George W Bush}[0m .
