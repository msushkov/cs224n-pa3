(0) [35m{President Vladimir Putin}[0m began [4m[34m{an official visit to Cuba}[0m Wednesday , [4m[34m{the first by a Russian leader since the collapse of the Soviet Union almost a decade ago}[0m . 
(1) [1m[34m{VOA 's}[0m Sonia Paes reports that unlike Soviet leaders , [35m{Mr. Putin}[0m intends to concentrate on business , not politics . 
(2) In the old days of the Cold War when Soviet leaders [32m{met}[0m with [36m{Cuba 's}[0m Fidel Castro , [32m{it}[0m was usually a time for bear hugs and long and often fiery ideological speeches . 
(3) Times have changed . 
(4) [35m{Russian President Vladimir Putin}[0m has made it clear [35m{he}[0m brings no ideological baggage with [35m{him}[0m to [36m{Cuba}[0m this week . 
(5) According to [1m[32m{political analyst Andre Reabov of the Carnegie Endowment in Moscow}[0m , strengthening [4m[33m{Russia 's}[0m business and economic ties with [36m{Cuba}[0m are a priority for [35m{Mr. Putin}[0m . 
(6) Seems to [1m[32m{me}[0m that one of the goals of [4m[34m{this visit}[0m is to help , maybe to advance the interest of Russian companies in [36m{this island}[0m and maybe to restore [4m[36m{the economical relationship between the Russian Federation and Cuba}[0m . 
(7) During Soviet times , [1m[36m{Moscow}[0m poured in cash to subsidize the Cuban economy . 
(8) [1m[36m{The Soviet Union}[0m provided [36m{Cuba}[0m with oil , petroleum products , foodstuffs and heavy machinery . 
(9) In return [1m[36m{Moscow}[0m took Cuban sugar , citrus fruits , nickel and cobalt . 
(10) Today [3m[31m{bilateral trade}[0m is a fraction of what [3m[31m{it}[0m once was and stands at under one billion dollars a year . 
(11) [35m{President Putin}[0m has said it was a mistake to let [4m[36m{that relationship}[0m wither and to allow foreign competitors to take the place that Russian enterprises once held . 
(12) The debt issue is certain to come up during talks in [1m[35m{Havana}[0m . 
(13) [4m[33m{Moscow}[0m would like to see [36m{Cuba}[0m repay some of the billions of dollars [36m{it}[0m still owes from loans that date back to the Soviet era . 
(14) No breakthrough agreements are expected but discussions are likely to also focus on finishing or reactivating a number of projects begun during Soviet times . 
(15) [35m{The Russian leader}[0m meets with [1m[31m{President Castro}[0m [34m{Thursday}[0m morning and is also to hold talks with National Assembly President Ricardo Alarkon . 
(16) The issue of Cuban - American affairs is another likely topic of discussion . 
(17) On Tuesday [35m{President Putin}[0m called for an end to the American trade embargo against [36m{Cuba}[0m . 
(18) [1m[32m{Political analyst Riyardov}[0m thinks [35m{Mr. Putin}[0m would like to encourage some sort of a between [33m{Havana and Washington}[0m , much as [35m{he}[0m has tried to do earlier this year with [31m{the United States}[0m and [4m[35m{North Korea}[0m . 
(19) [35m{Mr. Putin}[0m tried to play the role of mediator between [4m[35m{the Kinshumir regime of the Northern Korea}[0m and [31m{the US administration}[0m . 
(20) Seems to [1m[32m{me}[0m [35m{he}[0m would delight to try to use the same line in the relationship between [1m[31m{the Castro 's}[0m regime and [31m{the US administration}[0m too . 
(21) Such an attempt would be in line with [35m{Mr. Putin 's}[0m overall foreign policy agenda . 
(22) [35m{He}[0m wants to [1m[33m{enhance}[0m [4m[33m{Russia 's}[0m standing in the world and to do [1m[33m{that}[0m [35m{he}[0m believes that [4m[33m{Moscow}[0m must assume a greater role in international affairs . 
(23) After talks in [1m[35m{Havana}[0m on [34m{Thursday}[0m , [35m{Mr. Putin}[0m and [35m{his}[0m wife are scheduled to head to one of [36m{Cuba 's}[0m premier beach resorts for two days of rest before traveling on to Canada . 
(24) [4m[31m{Sonia Paes}[0m , [1m[34m{VOA News}[0m , [3m[32m{Moscow}[0m .
