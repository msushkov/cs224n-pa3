(0) Want another advantage of hydrogen over oil ? 
(1) Well , when is the last time you heard of a hydrogen spill threatening a sensitive ecosystem ? 
(2) Today more than a week after [4m[32m{a tanker}[0m [31m{spilled}[0m [1m[33m{a 180 thousand gallons of oil}[0m near [36m{the Galapagos Islands}[0m , experts are warning that it could take several days to drag [4m[32m{the ship}[0m away , and [4m[32m{the tanker 's}[0m captain now faces charges that could land [4m[31m{him}[0m up to 5 years in prison . 
(3) [4m[33m{The BBC 's}[0m Tim Hersh reports from [1m[31m{one of the Ecuadorian Islands}[0m . 
(4) [4m[31m{The captain of the Jessica Tokinio Arivalo}[0m is being held at the Port Authority building on [1m[31m{San Kristobal}[0m which looks directly out to [4m[32m{the stricken tanker still stranded on a reef after running aground nine days ago}[0m . 
(5) [4m[31m{Mr. Arivala}[0m said [4m[31m{he}[0m had [4m[36m{mistaken}[0m a channel marker at the entrance to [32m{the harbor}[0m for a lighthouse . 
(6) [4m[31m{He}[0m spoke of [4m[31m{his}[0m horror as [4m[32m{the vessel}[0m ran aground and [4m[31m{he}[0m realized [4m[31m{his}[0m mistake . 
(7) In that moment [4m[31m{I}[0m felt like it was right up to [4m[31m{me}[0m to die . 
(8) [4m[31m{I}[0m know what 's happening now , but that time [4m[31m{I}[0m did n't know . 
(9) [4m[31m{I}[0m had nine nights , [4m[34m{nine days}[0m , not eating nor sleeping . 
(10) [4m[31m{I}[0m feel sick because [4m[31m{I}[0m do n't feel guilty for that . 
(11) Formal proceedings are now underway to prosecute [4m[31m{Mr. Arivalo}[0m and [1m[34m{the owners of the Jessica}[0m . 
(12) An official from the Ecuadorian prosecuting authorities Alfrado Alvea arrived on [1m[31m{the island}[0m to announce the start of legal action . 
(13) [35m{The owners of the boat , the captain , the crew}[0m , they will send [35m{you , all the persons who 've made that damage}[0m , up to five years to the jail and pay all the damage [35m{they}[0m have cost . 
(14) Out in [32m{the harbor}[0m preparations are being made to attach cables to [4m[32m{the tanker}[0m so that [4m[32m{it}[0m can be floated and towed out to sea , where [4m[32m{it}[0m 's expected to be sunk . 
(15) Edwin Stanton of the United States Coastguard says [34m{the rough sea conditions}[0m have helped to reduce the environmental damage from [31m{the oil spill}[0m . 
(16) Paradoxically , [34m{the surf that 's washing over the boat and causing damage to the vessel}[0m has been mixing the diesel with [1m[33m{the heavy oil}[0m and allowing both to evaporate and mix into the water very well , so [33m{Mother Nature}[0m give us and [33m{Mother Nature}[0m take it away . 
(17) No major oil concentrations have been sighted recently more than 6 miles northwest of the source of [4m[32m{the vessel}[0m , so much of [1m[33m{it}[0m is naturally [4m[35m{dissipating}[0m and evaporating . 
(18) We are very lucky in [4m[35m{that}[0m , but conservation scientists are still very concerned about small amounts of oil which have washed up on beaches up to 80 kilometers away , possibly threatening creatures , including [36m{Galapagos '}[0m sea turtles . 
(19) Ecological disaster may have been averted , but the wildlife is not completely safe yet . 
(20) [4m[33m{The BBC 's}[0m Tim Hersh reporting from [1m[31m{the Galapagos Island of San Kristobal}[0m .
