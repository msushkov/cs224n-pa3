(0) In [3m[35m{New Delhi}[0m today , [4m[35m{Indians}[0m like Americans are consuming [4m[35m{their}[0m favorite traditional foods , roties , dal and increasingly burgers and fries . 
(1) The Golden Arches and the Kentucky Colonel are becoming familiar sites in [1m[35m{the country}[0m and as [3m[36m{the World 's}[0m Tinku Ray reports , many Indians are giving a fast welcome to fast food . 
(2) Visit [4m[31m{any McDonalds in the capital}[0m and [4m[31m{it}[0m will be packed with families , [4m[31m{the young and old}[0m enthusiastically eating [4m[31m{their}[0m burgers and fries . 
(3) [1m[31m{The American fast food giant}[0m opened [1m[31m{its}[0m first outlet in [1m[35m{India}[0m four years ago and has now expanded to twenty - five around [1m[35m{the country}[0m . 
(4) But imagine a McDonalds without beef , no big macs , no cheese burgers , instead the choice is McAlu tikki burger or chicken kebabs . 
(5) Vikram Bakshi , Managing Director of [4m[32m{McDonalds India}[0m explains the customized menu . 
(6) [4m[32m{We}[0m knew that [4m[32m{we}[0m were in [1m[35m{a country , which is culturally sensitive}[0m . 
(7) From [1m[36m{day one}[0m [4m[32m{we}[0m went beefless and porkless , so [4m[32m{we}[0m could look after the sentiments of both the Hindus and the Muslims . 
(8) From [1m[36m{day one}[0m [4m[32m{we}[0m knew that there was [4m[36m{an issue about vegetarianism}[0m . 
(9) [4m[32m{We}[0m had to be very conscious about [4m[36m{it}[0m and [4m[32m{we}[0m did a segregation in [4m[32m{our}[0m kitchens , which has been unheard of . 
(10) And the strategy has been a popular one for [1m[31m{McDonalds}[0m , as a sample poll of lunchtime customers outside a restaurant in South Delhi shows . 
(11) We get a lot of variety here and it 's very tasty also . 
(12) If [4m[32m{they}[0m [31m{offered}[0m [3m[32m{you}[0m [36m{only , say , a fully western menu}[0m , would [36m{it}[0m still appeal to [3m[32m{you}[0m ? 
(13) No , no [31m{that}[0m 's not good . 
(14) [3m[32m{I}[0m think it should be both , the Western and the Indian , both . 
(15) [33m{The food here offered}[0m is a lot better than what you find in [4m[34m{the US}[0m . 
(16) In what ways ? 
(17) Here , you know , it 's like [33m{it}[0m 's American as well as Indian taste . 
(18) It 's a very wise move for [4m[32m{them}[0m because if [4m[32m{they}[0m would have only just original McDonalds , [3m[33m{I}[0m do n't think [4m[32m{they}[0m would have done so great . 
(19) [3m[33m{I}[0m think by blending things , you know , [4m[32m{they}[0m have done a very wise move . 
(20) Along the narrow crowded streets of old Delhi , is where you can find [1m[34m{fast food , Indian style}[0m . 
(21) These are roadside restaurants often called dhabas that serve up recipes of dal , vegetables and stuffed puries , deep - fried in oil . 
(22) [1m[34m{This traditional and cheap fare}[0m has proved stiff competition for [35m{the multinational fast food chains}[0m , but [35m{they}[0m 've been fighting hard and maybe closing in . 
(23) [1m[33m{Pizza delivery chain Dominos}[0m turned a profit for the first time last year , after five years in the Indian market . 
(24) [1m[33m{Dominos}[0m has also adapted to [32m{Indian tastes}[0m by creating special toppings , butter chicken and chana masala pizzas . 
(25) The simple idea of home delivery is also rather new to [1m[35m{India}[0m , but seems to have captured people 's imagination . 
(26) [1m[33m{Dominos}[0m Chief Executive Pawan Bhatia says , the secret of [1m[33m{their}[0m success is to introduce Western brands with an Indian twist . 
(27) If [1m[32m{I}[0m walk in to [4m[33m{a lot of the companies who failed}[0m and if you put this , have [4m[33m{they}[0m given a choice and the answer most of the time will be no . 
(28) [4m[33m{They}[0m have decided the menu . 
(29) [1m[35m{India}[0m is a deeply religious and traditional country , but in the past decade thanks to [3m[36m{globalization}[0m and cable TV , [4m[35m{the population}[0m has been exposed to dozens of multinational brands from burgers to washing machines and pizzas to Pepsi , but despite the desire to embrace [3m[36m{globalization}[0m , there is still a reluctance to change completely . 
(30) Marketing analyst Sohail Seth , believes that [34m{fast food companies}[0m will only survive if [34m{they}[0m take seriously the need to be culturally sensitive . 
(31) As a nation [4m[35m{we}[0m do n't like to experiment too much , so [3m[31m{food}[0m is such a personal item , [3m[31m{it}[0m 's such an important item of [4m[35m{our}[0m daily existence that the last thing [4m[35m{we}[0m 'd like is any international fast food company coming in and tinkering with [4m[35m{our}[0m palate . 
(32) Ironically , what the Western fast food chains are doing here is the same as what Indian restaurants have done and been very successful at in [4m[34m{the United States}[0m and Europe , adapting and adjusting according to local tastes . 
(33) For [3m[36m{The World}[0m , [3m[34m{this}[0m is Tinku Ray , [3m[35m{New Delhi}[0m .
