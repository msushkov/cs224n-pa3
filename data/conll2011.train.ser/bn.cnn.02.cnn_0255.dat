(0) On [36m{we}[0m go in the meantime . 
(1) Again , today , there were disturbing hints , and [36m{we}[0m underscore hints here , that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons . 
(2) Yesterday the story centered on intelligence regarding enemy intentions . 
(3) Today the evidence is somewhat more tangible . 
(4) Reporting for [36m{us}[0m , [36m{CNN 's}[0m David Ensor . 
(5) Reporter : 
(6) The evidence is accumulating that [1m[32m{Iraq}[0m may be planning to use chemical weapons . 
(7) Gas masks turning up in abandoned trenches . 
(8) In Nasiriyah in a building marked as a hospital [32m{U.S. Marines}[0m found [4m[34m{weapons , atropine antidote kits}[0m , and [4m[34m{that}[0m was not all . 
(9) [32m{They}[0m found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well as a number of Iraqi military uniforms . 
(10) Reporter : 
(11) The findings are heightening concerns among coalition forces approaching [4m[36m{Baghdad}[0m since , as [1m[32m{the Iraqis}[0m should know , U.S. and British forces do not use chemical weapons . 
(12) U.S. officials say some intelligence indicates [4m[33m{a red line}[0m may have been drawn around [4m[36m{the capital}[0m with [1m[31m{Republican Guard}[0m units ordered to use chemical weapons once U.S. and allied troops cross [4m[33m{it}[0m . 
(13) There is also intelligence , officials say , suggesting [1m[31m{Republican Guard}[0m units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical agents . 
(14) There has been [35m{intelligence scraps , who knows how accurate they are , chatter in the system , that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to Baghdad and Tikrit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place}[0m . 
(15) Reporter : 
(16) In [4m[36m{Baghdad}[0m [1m[33m{Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz}[0m repeated [1m[33m{his}[0m government 's stand -- [1m[32m{it}[0m does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction . 
(17) Translator : 
(18) When they started to [34m{talk}[0m about the weapons of mass destruction , [33m{we}[0m know and [33m{we}[0m always knew that [34m{that}[0m was fabrication and lies . 
(19) Reporter : 
(20) Experts say [31m{Saddam Hussein 's}[0m forces will likely try to hold out in [4m[36m{Baghdad}[0m for as long as possible without using the weapons [31m{his}[0m government insists [1m[32m{it}[0m does not have , hoping to build international pressure on the U.S. and Britain to back down . 
(21) In that sense [4m[35m{any use of chemical weapons}[0m would be counterproductive to [31m{Saddam}[0m , because [4m[35m{it}[0m would only galvanize international --
