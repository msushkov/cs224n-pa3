(0) [3m[33m{General Brooks talking about three major points .}[0m 
(1) One is [1m[32m{the capture of number 24 as it 's described , Samir who is responsible for the Baghdad district}[0m . 
(2) Indications are the Kurds in [1m[34m{the north}[0m handed [3m[31m{this man}[0m over so [3m[31m{this}[0m is number 4 out of that playing card deck of 55 that the U.S. is after , top leaders in Iraq . 
(3) Also [3m[34m{that bomb site in Baghdad hit about a week and a half ago}[0m , the Mansour district . 
(4) No remains identified just yet , [3m[33m{General Brooks}[0m says , but only the initial surveys have been completed so far . 
(5) There is strong speculation that his two sons were inside of [3m[34m{that building}[0m when [3m[34m{it}[0m was [1m[31m{hit}[0m by coalition bombs , or may have left prior to [1m[31m{the bombing}[0m taking place . 
(6) Again , all this is an outstanding issue right now . 
(7) In [1m[34m{the north}[0m , you 're going to hear a lot about [1m[36m{the shallow graves}[0m today . 
(8) [1m[36m{At least 1500 , maybe 1600 graves}[0m located in [1m[34m{the north}[0m . 
(9) [3m[32m{Jane Arraf}[0m has made [3m[32m{her}[0m way to [1m[34m{that location}[0m and [1m[35m{we}[0m heard [3m[32m{her}[0m first live report about an hour ago and [1m[35m{we}[0m will talk with [3m[32m{Jane}[0m again . 
(10) [1m[35m{We}[0m know that , quote , work will be done with the Iraqis and that work will come , [1m[35m{we}[0m are told , in the coming days . 
(11) A wrap from CentCom and here is Fredricka Whitfield at the CNN Center .
