(1) [3m[35m{This year}[0m , [1m[32m{Shandong Province}[0m began to implement [3m[31m{the policy of employee housing monetization allocation}[0m within the bounds of [1m[32m{the entire province}[0m , meaning that [3m[33m{city and township employees}[0m can no longer get housing from the work unit [3m[33m{they}[0m work for like before . 
(2) Henceforth , using money to buy a living place or using rent to rent housing will become the new mechanism . 
(3) [1m[32m{Shandong}[0m is currently the first province to implement [3m[31m{the policy of housing monetization allocation}[0m in [3m[36m{China}[0m . 
(4) Moreover , provinces and cities such as Guangdong , [4m[31m{Shanghai}[0m , etc. are also implementing this kind of experimental work in housing allocation system reform . 
(5) The State Ministry of Finance and the State Housing Reform Office granted full recognition to [3m[31m{this}[0m . 
(6) At the end of last year , [3m[36m{China}[0m , at a series of meetings , pointed out that one of the key tasks of the 1998 reform is to accelerate housing system reform , to accelerate the process of transforming housing from a material allocation to a monetary allocation , and to establish a new method to monetize benefit allocations . 
(7) In the past few decades , although housing was always a top matter of expense for [3m[36m{China 's}[0m countryside residents , but in the cities and towns , however , housing was treated as an employee benefit , freely allocated by work units , and only needing extremely low rent to be submitted every month . 
(8) In 1994 , after the " State Council 's decision to deepen city and township housing system reform " was announced , city and township employee housing started to [1m[33m{take}[0m steps in the direction of threefold common responsibility , namely the [3m[36m{State}[0m , the collective and the individual . 
(9) An obvious sign of [1m[33m{this}[0m is the housing accumulation fund system starting to be commonly established . 
(10) According to what was revealed at the working forum on housing reform work in some provinces and cities held in [1m[36m{Beijing}[0m recently , currently the total amount of national accumulation funds surpassed 80 billion yuan . 
(11) This huge accumulation fund is playing an increasingly obvious role in supporting individuals to purchase housing and housing construction . 
(12) At the same time , there has been a big increase in [3m[36m{the nation 's}[0m monthly rent of public housing in cities and townships , with some regions increasing to account for about 10 % of the income of dual income families . 
(13) Although the pace of housing reform is being accelerated , the old method of allocating housing through benefits has still has not been broken through . 
(14) According to a recent survey conducted among residents of [4m[32m{5 cities , namely Beijing , Shanghai , Tianjin , Chongqing and Guangzhou ,}[0m relying on work units to allocate housing still remains the main avenue of residential housing in [4m[32m{these 5 cities}[0m . 
(15) In [4m[31m{Shanghai}[0m , 62.4 % of the residents currently still have housing still under work unit allocation . 
(16) Yunfa Zhu and Yanqun Zhang , economic scholars of [3m[36m{China 's}[0m Social Science Institute , said : " monetizing housing allocation is [1m[31m{a large trend}[0m " . 
(17) [1m[31m{Its}[0m central content is to abolish benefit housing allocation , and at the same time to increase housing expense amounts in employee salaries . 
(18) [3m[34m{Director of the City and Township Construction Committee , Junmin Wang , who is in charge of the housing reform work of Shandong Province ,}[0m believes that although the aim of housing reform is to realize " [1m[35m{residents}[0m have [1m[35m{their}[0m own houses " and housing commercialization , yet considering government financial strength , the condition of enterprise operations , and the level of employee incomes , at present , still only selling houses and renting houses at cost can be put into practice . 
(19) [3m[34m{Junmin Wang}[0m said that if the money from employees paying rent is used to pay a mortgage , with housing subsidies and the housing accumulation fund , a dual income family purchasing [1m[34m{a 75 square - meter , 2 bedroom , economy apartment}[0m , according to the 1996 cost price , will need 12 years . 
(20) If loans such as mortgages , guarantees and installments , etc. , are also utilized to pay , employees can definitely afford [1m[34m{it}[0m . 
(21) If a one - time housing subsidy is also used , the economic environment of [3m[32m{employees}[0m buying houses will be eased even more . 
(22) It was learned that [3m[36m{China}[0m currently has about 66 million square meters of commercial housing overstocked . 
(23) Financial departments have been requested to develop employee personal housing mortgage and loan business to increase [3m[32m{their}[0m purchasing ability . 
(24) Last year , the size of the China Construction Bank and the Industrial and Commerce Bank 's personal housing mortgages and loans increased to 10 billion yuan . 
(25) Concerned departments also cancelled some fee items so as to lower housing construction costs . 
(26) When analyzing and forecasting [3m[35m{this year 's}[0m economy , [1m[36m{Beijing}[0m economists recently said that accelerating starting the city and township housing expenses will possibly cause the housing industry to become a new growth point of the domestic economy in [3m[35m{1998}[0m .
