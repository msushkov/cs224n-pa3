(0) [4m[36m{Our}[0m founder here at [4m[36m{CNN}[0m , Ted Turner , has [3m[36m{sold}[0m [1m[34m{more than half his stake in AOL Time Warner}[0m . 
(1) [1m[34m{That}[0m 's a lot of shares and a lot of money . 
(2) [35m{Andy Serwer}[0m 's looking into [3m[36m{that}[0m and the markets . 
(3) If you 're investing , why now ? 
(4) Chitchat in the Time Life Building here at [3m[31m{AOL}[0m and all over Wall Street , [4m[31m{Ted Turner}[0m selling [1m[34m{60 million shares}[0m for $ 800 million , [1m[34m{more than half of his stake in the company}[0m . 
(5) [4m[31m{He}[0m opens 40 million plus now . 
(6) Question is , Why ? Why is [4m[31m{he}[0m selling ? 
(7) [35m{I}[0m think , [4m[31m{he}[0m 's at least -- hedging [4m[31m{his}[0m bets by keeping [1m[35m{40 million shares}[0m but basically [4m[31m{he}[0m 's decided that [3m[31m{the company}[0m is not going where [4m[31m{he}[0m wants [3m[31m{it}[0m to go and [4m[31m{he}[0m 's bailing out . 
(8) You know , a lot of concern obviously by people who still own [4m[35m{the stock}[0m . 
(9) [35m{My}[0m point about this , if [4m[31m{Ted Turner}[0m were so smart and [4m[31m{he}[0m 's a very smart guy but [4m[31m{he}[0m did not sell at the top , okay ? 
(10) [4m[31m{He}[0m did n't sell at $ 60 . 
(11) Hind sight would have liked to have gotten that . 
(12) [4m[31m{He}[0m believed in the merger like most other people did . 
(13) We 'll look back five years from now , you can see , [4m[31m{he}[0m has lost a lot of money . 
(14) You know , [4m[31m{He}[0m still had $ 1.7 billion , we 're not shedding tears . 
(15) [4m[31m{He}[0m did have $ 8 billion . 
(16) [4m[31m{He}[0m 's left a lot on the table . 
(17) We 'll look back five years from now , when [4m[35m{the stock}[0m is either at $ 13 still or $ 8 or $ 30 and say , [4m[31m{he}[0m was either very smart or not smart at all . 
(18) [4m[31m{He}[0m 's still hedging [4m[31m{his}[0m bet by keeping [1m[35m{40 million stake}[0m . 
(19) [3m[32m{I}[0m hope [4m[31m{he}[0m 's wrong . 
(20) [35m{Me}[0m , too . 
(21) The question , I 'm an [3m[31m{AOL}[0m shareholder sitting at home , [32m{hearing}[0m this news , Does [32m{this}[0m set off a few alarms ? Will people panic and everybody sell [4m[35m{it}[0m ? 
(22) [3m[32m{I}[0m think [4m[35m{the stock}[0m will be weaker today . 
(23) Again , you know , [4m[35m{the stock}[0m has drifted below $ 10 . 
(24) [4m[35m{It}[0m 's been in the neighborhood for a while . 
(25) [3m[32m{I}[0m do n't see [4m[35m{the thing}[0m going down a lot . 
(26) Interesting point here also , people are suggesting [4m[31m{he}[0m may be raising this money to buy [33m{those Atlanta sports teams that apparently are on the block}[0m . 
(27) [33m{The Braves and Thrashers .}[0m 
(28) [35m{You}[0m really think ? 
(29) [3m[32m{You}[0m know , [35m{I}[0m 'm not sure . 
(30) apparently [33m{they}[0m 're for sale . 
(31) We 'll have to see about that . 
(32) Thank [35m{you}[0m . 
(33) Thank [3m[32m{you}[0m . 
(34) Let 's check with [36m{Jack}[0m now . 
(35) The question of the day , [4m[32m{Bill Bennet}[0m ? 
(36) [36m{I}[0m figure if [4m[31m{Turner}[0m 's smarter than [36m{I}[0m am , [36m{I}[0m 'm selling [36m{my}[0m 80 shares . 
(37) [4m[34m{80 of them .}[0m 
(38) $ 13 and change , out . 
(39) Talking about [4m[32m{Bill Bennet}[0m [1m[33m{this morning}[0m [4m[32m{one of the country 's leading crusaders for morality author of `` Virtues ''}[0m and [34m{admits}[0m [4m[32m{he}[0m has a gambling problem . 
(40) Me . 
(41) [4m[32m{he}[0m made the [34m{admission}[0m after [4m[32m{Bennett}[0m lost up to $ 8 million in casinos in the last decade . 
(42) The articles say [4m[32m{he}[0m won at times that [4m[32m{he}[0m had $ 200,000 lines of credit at several laying casinos . 
(43) Gambling , however , is not one of the vices [4m[32m{Bennett}[0m thinks is undermining American culture . 
(44) [4m[36m{We}[0m want to hear from viewers [1m[33m{this morning}[0m . 
(45) [4m[32m{He}[0m does say [4m[32m{he}[0m 's going to stop . 
(46) [31m{News of Bill Bennet 's gambling}[0m changed your opinion of [4m[32m{him}[0m ? 
(47) Many , many responses .

(49) Hypocrite . 
(50) [3m[35m{Barbara}[0m , [4m[32m{Bill Bennet}[0m 's glam gambling loss changed [3m[35m{my}[0m opinion . 
(51) [1m[36m{Linda}[0m writes [4m[32m{he}[0m can do what [4m[32m{he}[0m wants with [4m[32m{his}[0m money . 
(52) [1m[36m{I}[0m thought [4m[32m{he}[0m was smarter than that . 
(53) [3m[33m{Lawrence in Missouri}[0m , after sitting in front of [3m[33m{my}[0m TV night after night , listening to [4m[32m{him}[0m , watching every perversion , sin and evil known to man or beast , being glamourized by sitcoms and TV talking heads , imagine [3m[33m{my}[0m shock in hearing [4m[32m{that Bill Bennet}[0m being soundly condemned for gambling . 
(54) Is this the beginning of a new morality ?
