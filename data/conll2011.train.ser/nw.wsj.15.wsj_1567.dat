(0) WHEN [32m{JAMES SCHWARTZ}[0m was just a lad [32m{his}[0m father gave [32m{him}[0m a piece of career advice . 
(1) `` [3m[36m{He}[0m told [32m{me}[0m to choose an area where just by being mediocre [32m{I}[0m could be great , '' recalls [32m{Mr. Schwartz , now 40}[0m . 
(2) [32m{He}[0m tried management consulting , traded in turquoise for a while , and even managed professional wrestlers . 
(3) Now [32m{he}[0m has settled into [3m[34m{a career that fits the bill -- financial planning}[0m . 
(4) It should be noted that [32m{Mr. Schwartz , who operates out of Englewood , Colo. ,}[0m is a puckish sort who likes to give [32m{his}[0m colleagues [36m{the needle}[0m . 
(5) But in this case [36m{the needle}[0m has a very sharp point . 
(6) Though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent , the fact remains that , as one wag puts it , `` [1m[33m{anybody who can fog a mirror}[0m '' can call [1m[33m{himself}[0m a financial planner . 
(7) [4m[32m{Planners}[0m now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars , but in effect [4m[32m{they}[0m operate in the dark . 
(8) There is no effective regulation of [1m[36m{planners}[0m , no accepted standard for admission into [1m[36m{their}[0m ranks -- [1m[32m{a dog}[0m got into [1m[36m{one trade group}[0m -- no way to assess [1m[36m{their}[0m performance , no way even to know how many of [1m[36m{them}[0m there are -LRB- estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000 -RRB- . 
(9) All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning . 
(10) So it should come as no shock that [3m[34m{the profession}[0m , if that 's what [3m[34m{it}[0m is , has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat - out stealing their clients ' money . 
(11) Alarmed , state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners . 
(12) [1m[36m{Industry groups}[0m and reputable planners who are members of [1m[36m{them}[0m want comprehensive standards , too ; [4m[36m{they}[0m 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine . 
(13) But reform has n't taken hold yet . 
(14) `` [1m[34m{The industry}[0m is still pretty much in [1m[34m{its}[0m Wild West days , '' says [3m[33m{Scott Stapf , director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association}[0m . 
(15) An admittedly limited survey by [1m[32m{NASAA , whose members are state securities - law regulators ,}[0m found that between [3m[36m{1986}[0m and [3m[31m{1988}[0m `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $ 400 million . 
(16) [1m[31m{The rogues ' gallery of planners involved}[0m includes [3m[31m{some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother}[0m . 
(17) What 's more , the losses [3m[31m{they}[0m and the others caused `` are just what [1m[32m{we}[0m are stumbling over , '' says [3m[33m{Mr. Stapf}[0m , adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected . 
(18) So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners . 
(19) Nobody can estimate the toll , but [33m{John Gargan , a Tampa , Fla. , planner and head of one trade group , the International Association of Registered Financial Planners ,}[0m thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery . 
(20) [33m{His}[0m group , like others , wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners . 
(21) Surveying all this , some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all . 
(22) For most investors `` the benefits just are n't worth the risks , '' says [32m{Barbara Roper , who follows financial - planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America , a consumer - advocacy organization based in Washington}[0m . 
(23) [32m{She}[0m concedes that [3m[35m{such a position}[0m is `` unfair '' to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying [3m[34m{the trade}[0m , but as a consumer advocate [32m{she}[0m feels impelled to take [3m[35m{it}[0m . 
(24) [32m{She}[0m says [32m{her}[0m group used to give [34m{tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials , consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus}[0m -- but found that even some people who took [34m{these steps}[0m `` were still getting ripped off . '' 
(25) The bad news , however , has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for [3m[36m{financial planning}[0m . 
(26) The Tax Reform Act of [3m[36m{1986}[0m , which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners , and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand , and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from [3m[36m{the business}[0m . 
(27) But [35m{membership in the International Association of Financial Planners -LRB- IAFP -RRB- , the industry 's biggest trade group ,}[0m is still nearly triple what [35m{it}[0m was in [4m[31m{1980}[0m , and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well . 
(28) An estimated 10 million Americans are now using [1m[35m{financial planners}[0m , and the pool of capital [1m[35m{they}[0m influence is enormous . 
(29) A survey of [3m[33m{54,000 of them}[0m conducted by [1m[36m{the IAFP}[0m in April showed that [3m[33m{these practitioners alone}[0m had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of [3m[33m{their}[0m clients ' money in the previous 12 months . 
(30) The sheer number of [31m{planners}[0m makes [3m[36m{the business}[0m extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate . 
(31) Even the minority of [31m{them}[0m who must register with [35m{the Securities and Exchange Commission}[0m as `` investment advisers '' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp [35m{the agency 's}[0m capacity . 
(32) [35m{The SEC}[0m has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in [4m[31m{1980}[0m -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade . 
(33) Currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an [35m{SEC}[0m audit only once every 12 years . 
(34) A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years . 
(35) `` It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out [35m{our}[0m problem , '' says Kathryn McGrath , director of [35m{the SEC 's}[0m division of investment management . 
(36) So [35m{the SEC}[0m has [4m[33m{proposed}[0m to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry - funded , self - regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers , which operates in the brokerage business . 
(37) Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules . 
(38) [4m[33m{The proposal}[0m has set off a lively debate within [1m[34m{an industry that was far from united to begin with}[0m . 
(39) [32m{Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. ,}[0m says that allowing [3m[36m{the business}[0m to police [3m[36m{itself}[0m would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank . '' 
(40) [33m{Mr. Gargan , the Tampa planner who heads one trade group ,}[0m favors simply assessing [1m[34m{the industry}[0m and giving the money to [35m{the SEC}[0m to hire more staff . 
(41) -LRB- [33m{Mr. Gargan 's}[0m views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at [1m[36m{the IAFP , the major industry organization}[0m . 
(42) When [1m[36m{the IAFP}[0m recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners , [33m{Mr. Gargan 's}[0m group was [4m[34m{excluded}[0m . 
(43) [4m[34m{That}[0m may be because [33m{Mr. Gargan}[0m , smarting at what [33m{he}[0m considered slurs on [33m{his}[0m membership standards made by [1m[36m{the rival group}[0m , enrolled [33m{his}[0m dog , Beauregard , as a member of [1m[36m{the IAFP}[0m . 
(44) Then [33m{he}[0m sent [1m[32m{the pooch 's}[0m picture with [4m[32m{the certificate of membership}[0m -- [4m[32m{it}[0m was made out to `` [1m[32m{Boris ` Bo ' Regaard}[0m '' -- to every newspaper [33m{he}[0m could think of . -RRB- 
(45) [1m[31m{The states}[0m have [1m[31m{their}[0m own ideas about regulation and certification . 
(46) [1m[32m{NASAA , the organization of state securities regulators ,}[0m is pushing for [4m[33m{a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states}[0m . 
(47) [4m[33m{It}[0m requires financial planners to register with states , pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest . 
(48) The most common conflict involves compensation . 
(49) [1m[32m{NASAA}[0m estimates that [1m[34m{nearly 90 % of planners}[0m receive some or all of [1m[34m{their}[0m income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products [1m[34m{they}[0m recommend . 
(50) The issue : Is [34m{the planner}[0m putting [34m{his}[0m clients into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions ? 
(51) In [3m[36m{1986}[0m [3m[32m{the New York attorney general 's}[0m office got an order from a state court in [3m[33m{Albany}[0m shutting down [3m[35m{First Meridian Corp. , an Albany financial - planning firm that had invested $ 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors}[0m . 
(52) In [3m[32m{its}[0m notice of action , [3m[32m{the attorney general}[0m said [3m[35m{the company}[0m had promised to put clients into `` balanced '' investment portfolios ; instead , [3m[32m{the attorney general}[0m alleged , [3m[35m{the company}[0m consistently shoved unwary customers into [4m[34m{high - risk investments in paintings , coins and Florida condos}[0m . 
(53) [4m[34m{Those investments}[0m [33m{paid}[0m big commissions to [3m[35m{First Meridian}[0m , [33m{payments investors were never told about}[0m , [3m[32m{the attorney general}[0m alleged . 
(54) Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted . 
(55) In practice , [3m[32m{the attorney general}[0m alleged in an affidavit , if an investor had access to cash `` the chances of being turned down by [3m[35m{First Meridian}[0m were about as probable as being rejected by the Book - of - the - Month Club . '' 
(56) And , [3m[32m{the attorney general}[0m added , [3m[35m{First Meridian 's}[0m president , Roger V. Sala , portrayed [3m[34m{himself}[0m as a `` financial expert '' when [3m[34m{his}[0m qualifications largely consisted of a high - school diploma , work as a real - estate and insurance salesman , and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth . 
(57) [3m[35m{First Meridian}[0m and [3m[35m{its}[0m officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing , according to a spokeswoman for [3m[32m{the attorney general}[0m . 
(58) [4m[33m{Harry Manion , Mr. Sala 's attorney ,}[0m says [4m[33m{his}[0m client denies any wrongdoing and adds that [3m[32m{the attorney general 's}[0m contentions about [3m[35m{First Meridian 's}[0m business practices are incorrect . 
(59) As for [3m[34m{Mr. Sala 's}[0m qualifications , `` the snooty attorneys for [31m{the state of New York}[0m decided [3m[34m{Mr. Sala}[0m was n't qualified because [3m[34m{he}[0m did n't have a Harvard degree , '' says [4m[33m{Mr. Manion}[0m . 
(60) Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common . 
(61) [3m[32m{Two such actions , both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta ,}[0m could be particularly embarrassing to [1m[34m{the industry}[0m : [3m[32m{both}[0m name [1m[35m{J. Chandler Peterson , an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP ,}[0m as defendant . 
(62) [4m[31m{One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors ,}[0m charges that [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m misused much of [4m[31m{the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted}[0m , spending some of [4m[31m{it}[0m to pay [1m[35m{his}[0m own legal bills and to invest in [1m[35m{other companies in which he had an interest}[0m . 
(63) [1m[35m{Those companies}[0m , in turn , paid [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m commissions and fees , [4m[31m{the suit}[0m alleges . 
(64) [3m[31m{The other suit}[0m was filed by [3m[32m{two men}[0m in a dispute over [33m{$ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz}[0m . 
(65) [4m[35m{One plaintiff , a doctor ,}[0m testified in an affidavit that [4m[35m{he}[0m also gave [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m $ 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave [4m[35m{the physician}[0m `` the privilege of making additional investments '' with [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m . 
(66) In affidavits , [1m[32m{each plaintiff}[0m claims [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m promised [4m[34m{the bank purchase}[0m would be completed by the end of [3m[31m{1988}[0m or [33m{the money}[0m returned . 
(67) [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m took the [3m[32m{plaintiffs}[0m ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of [1m[34m{the bank 's}[0m directors . 
(68) Wearing a business suit and western - style hat and boots , [1m[35m{he}[0m opened up [1m[35m{his}[0m briefcase and dumped $ 1 million in cash on a table in front of [35m{the directors}[0m , says [3m[33m{Myron Diebel , the bank 's president}[0m . 
(69) `` [1m[35m{He}[0m said [1m[35m{he}[0m wanted to show the color of [1m[35m{his}[0m money , '' recalls [3m[33m{Mr. Diebel}[0m . 
(70) Bank officials , however , showed [1m[35m{him}[0m the door , and [4m[34m{the sale}[0m never came off . 
(71) According to [3m[31m{the suit}[0m , [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m has yet to return [3m[32m{the plaintiffs '}[0m investment . 
(72) [3m[32m{They}[0m want [33m{it}[0m back . 
(73) [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m declines to comment on specific allegations in [3m[32m{the two suits}[0m , saying [1m[35m{he}[0m prefers to save such responses for court . 
(74) But [1m[35m{he}[0m does say that all of [1m[35m{his}[0m activities have been `` entirely proper . '' 
(75) On [4m[31m{the suit by the limited partners}[0m , [1m[35m{he}[0m says [1m[35m{he}[0m is considering a defamation suit against [4m[36m{the plaintiffs}[0m . 
(76) [4m[31m{The suit}[0m , [1m[35m{he}[0m adds , `` is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people . '' 
(77) Rearding [3m[31m{the suit over the bank bid}[0m , [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m says [3m[31m{it}[0m is filled with `` inflammatory language and half truths . '' 
(78) [1m[35m{He}[0m declines to go into specifics . 
(79) [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m says [3m[32m{the suits against him}[0m are less a measure of [1m[35m{his}[0m work than [3m[32m{they}[0m are a `` sign of the times '' in which people generally are more prone to sue . 
(80) `` [1m[35m{I}[0m do n't know anybody in [1m[34m{the industry}[0m who has n't experienced litigation , '' [1m[35m{he}[0m says . 
(81) [1m[35m{Mr. Peterson}[0m also says [1m[35m{he}[0m does n't consider [1m[35m{himself}[0m a financial planner anymore . 
(82) [1m[35m{He}[0m now calls [1m[35m{himself}[0m an `` investment banker . '' 
(83) In many scams or alleged scams involving planners , it 's plain that [4m[35m{only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors}[0m would have kept [1m[33m{them}[0m out of harm 's way . 
(84) Using [4m[35m{it}[0m , would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner ? 
(85) Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies : If [4m[32m{it}[0m sounds too good to be true , [4m[32m{it}[0m probably is . 
(86) Certificates of deposit [3m[34m{do}[0m n't pay 23 % a year , for example , but [3m[34m{that}[0m did n't give pause to [36m{clients of one Alabama planner}[0m . 
(87) Now [36m{they}[0m 're losers and [4m[35m{he}[0m 's in jail in Mobile County . 
(88) [31m{CDs yielding 40 %}[0m are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing `` bank '' in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas - station operator -- but investors fell for [31m{that one too}[0m . 
(89) And the [1m[31m{Colorado}[0m planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as $ 100 ? 
(90) Never mind . 
(91) You already know the answer . 
(92) Mr. Emshwiller is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau .
