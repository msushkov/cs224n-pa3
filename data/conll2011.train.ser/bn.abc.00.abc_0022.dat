(0) [3m[36m{The government}[0m said today [3m[36m{it}[0m 's going to cut back on the enormous number of people who descended on [1m[32m{Yemen}[0m to investigate [3m[35m{the attack on the `` USS Cole}[0m . '' 
(1) So many people from several agencies wanting to participate that [4m[34m{the Yemenis}[0m are feeling somewhat overwhelmed in [4m[34m{their}[0m own country . 
(2) Investigators have come up with another theory on how [3m[32m{the terrorists}[0m operated . 
(3) [3m[33m{ABC 's}[0m John Miller on [4m[32m{the house with a view}[0m . 
(4) High on a hillside , in a run - down section of [1m[35m{Aden}[0m , [4m[32m{the house with the blue door}[0m has [4m[33m{a perfect view of the harbor}[0m . 
(5) American and Yemeni investigators believe [4m[33m{that view}[0m is what convinced [1m[36m{a man who used the name Abdullah}[0m to rent [4m[32m{the house}[0m several weeks before [3m[35m{the bombing of the `` USS Cole}[0m . '' 
(6) Early on investigators theorized [3m[35m{it}[0m was an inside job and much of the focus was on employees of the Mansoon shipping company , which was under contract by the Navy to refuel U.S. warships and would have had advance information about [1m[34m{the `` Cole 's ''}[0m arrival . 
(7) Now the FBI believes all the [3m[32m{terrorists}[0m needed to do was look out the window , to go through precisely the same drill , well before [1m[34m{the `` Cole ''}[0m [4m[31m{arrived}[0m . 
(8) [1m[36m{The man in this house}[0m would have had plenty of time to signal two bombers waiting with the boat across the bay . 
(9) [3m[34m{Investigators}[0m say clues collected over the last few days have already pointed [3m[34m{them}[0m to locations both near and far outside [1m[35m{the port city of Aden}[0m , but [3m[34m{they}[0m wo n't say there 's [3m[31m{any indication that the plot here goes beyond Yemen 's boarders}[0m . 
(10) Learning the true identities of those involved in [3m[35m{the bombing}[0m would help answer [3m[31m{that question}[0m , but the two suicide bombers died in [3m[35m{the attack}[0m , and after [3m[35m{the explosion}[0m , [1m[36m{the man who lived behind the blue door}[0m simply vanished . 
(11) [1m[33m{John Miller}[0m , [3m[33m{ABC News}[0m , [1m[35m{Aden}[0m .
