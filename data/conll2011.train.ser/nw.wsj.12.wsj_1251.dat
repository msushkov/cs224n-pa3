(0) Fatalities on [32m{rural interstates}[0m rose 33 % between [4m[36m{1986}[0m and [4m[34m{last year}[0m , [31m{the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration}[0m said in [4m[33m{a report on the impact of the 65 miles - per - hour speed limit on those roads}[0m . 
(1) [4m[33m{The report to Congress}[0m said that fatalities rose 18 % in [33m{1987}[0m and 13 % in [4m[34m{1988}[0m on rural interstates . 
(2) The 1987 highway bill permitted states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads , which are defined as highways that pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people . 
(3) Since [33m{1987}[0m , [4m[35m{40 states}[0m have increased the speed limit on rural interstates . 
(4) `` About one - third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel , and about two - thirds is attributed to other factors -LCB- primarily to greater speed -RCB- , '' according to [31m{NHTSA}[0m . 
(5) [4m[33m{The report}[0m showed that deaths on urban interstate highways rose 7 % between [4m[36m{1986}[0m and [4m[34m{last year}[0m , while fatalities on non-interstate roads were about the same in [4m[34m{1988}[0m as in [4m[36m{1986}[0m . 
(6) In [4m[35m{states that raised the speed limit on rural interstates}[0m , the fatality rate rose about 18 % to 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled between [4m[36m{1986}[0m and [4m[34m{1988}[0m . 
(7) In contrast , the fatality rate in the states that retained the 55 mph limit was 0.9 [4m[34m{last year}[0m , the same as in [4m[36m{1986}[0m .
