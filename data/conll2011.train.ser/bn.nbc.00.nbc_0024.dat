(0) Now to the new face and shape of [3m[34m{Congress}[0m . 
(1) Republicans are still in [1m[36m{the majority}[0m , but the election has eaten away at the size of [1m[36m{that majority}[0m . 
(2) In the House of Representatives , Democrats are likely to pick up two seats , and in [3m[33m{the Senate}[0m , there could be a historic shift in the balance of power . 
(3) Here 's [4m[32m{NBC 's}[0m Lisa Myers . 
(4) [4m[34m{The first first lady ever elected to public office -- Hillary Clinton}[0m becomes an instant celebrity in [3m[33m{the Senate}[0m , serving alongside Republicans who tried to convict [4m[34m{her}[0m husband during impeachment . 
(5) [4m[34m{I}[0m think [4m[34m{I}[0m will get a very positive reception . 
(6) [4m[34m{I}[0m have worked with a number of the Republican members in the past . 
(7) [3m[36m{Today}[0m [3m[33m{the Senate 's}[0m top Republican offers an olive branch and some advice . 
(8) It would be wise for [4m[34m{her}[0m to take a little time maybe to just observe things and get used to the process and not try to , you know , assert too aggressively [4m[34m{her}[0m obvious celebrity status . 
(9) Otherwise , a lot of shell - shocked Republican senators [3m[36m{today}[0m , stunned after losing a net three and probably four seats . 
(10) The casualties -- Roth of Delaware , Abraham of Michigan , Grams of Minnesota , perhaps Gorton of Washington -- though that 's still too close to call -- and [1m[32m{Ashcroft of Missouri}[0m . 
(11) [1m[32m{Ashcroft}[0m lost to [1m[31m{the first dead man ever elected to the Senate , former Governor Mel Carnahan , who perished in a plane crash and whose wife will be appointed to his seat}[0m . 
(12) [1m[34m{Missouri}[0m is a compassionate state , and I think in a very special way , [1m[34m{they}[0m have demonstrated the compassion which [1m[34m{they}[0m have . 
(13) The strong likelihood of a 50 / 50 tie in [3m[33m{the Senate}[0m , which would be unprecedented , sent historians and parliamentarians scrambling for answers . 
(14) If [1m[35m{Bush}[0m wins , Dick Cheney , the Vice President , would break ties in [3m[33m{the Senate}[0m . 
(15) If [3m[31m{Gore}[0m wins , [4m[31m{Lieberman}[0m would resign [4m[31m{his}[0m [3m[33m{Senate}[0m seat and almost certainly be [1m[33m{replaced}[0m by a Republican , appointed by Connecticut 's Republican governor . 
(16) [1m[33m{That}[0m would give Republicans a 51 majority . 
(17) Either way , every vote is critical every day . 
(18) I jokingly said the most important person in [4m[35m{the Capitol}[0m is [3m[32m{the Capitol physician}[0m , making sure [3m[32m{he}[0m takes the pulse of every senator every morning . 
(19) [3m[36m{Today}[0m , [4m[33m{Democrats}[0m demand more power , reflecting [4m[33m{their}[0m new equal numbers . 
(20) [4m[33m{We}[0m recognize and I hope they recognize that the only way that [3m[34m{Congress}[0m will accomplish anything is through bipartisanship . 
(21) [3m[34m{The sharply divided Congress}[0m only complicates the task of [3m[35m{the new Prez}[0m . 
(22) Whether [3m[35m{it}[0m 's [1m[35m{Bush}[0m or [3m[31m{Gore}[0m , many here say [3m[35m{he}[0m may quickly find that getting elected was the easy part . 
(23) [36m{Lisa Myers}[0m , [4m[32m{NBC News}[0m , [4m[35m{the Capitol}[0m .
