(0) Not a whole lot happens in [1m[35m{Dornoch}[0m , but [3m[31m{tomorrow}[0m [1m[35m{the small Scottish town}[0m will [1m[31m{be}[0m the center of the universe . 
(1) At least [1m[31m{that}[0m 's the conclusion you might reach from seeing [4m[31m{the hundreds of journalists and photographers camped out there}[0m . 
(2) [4m[31m{They}[0m are all vying for [3m[32m{the story of the millennium , which is , as if you did n't know , tomorrow 's wedding of singer Madonna and filmmaker Guy Ritchie}[0m . 
(3) [3m[32m{This amazing , thrilling and fantastic story}[0m began today with the christening of [1m[36m{the couple 's}[0m four - month old boy ' Rocco . ' 
(4) [35m{Reporter Garith McClain}[0m is covering [3m[32m{the story}[0m for [36m{the London based Guardian newspaper}[0m . 
(5) Now [35m{Garith}[0m it sounds like the Scottish media have all gone mad . 
(6) Why this interest in [33m{an American pop star}[0m ? 
(7) [32m{We}[0m are surprised that [32m{we}[0m have such an American pop star in [1m[34m{Scotland itself}[0m , never mind up in [1m[35m{Dornoch which is near Inverness , which is the back of beyond even to most Scottish people}[0m . 
(8) [35m{I}[0m think [1m[35m{it}[0m [4m[32m{'s}[0m like the wilds of Washington State . 
(9) [35m{I}[0m think [4m[32m{it}[0m 's the best comparison [35m{I}[0m can make . 
(10) So [35m{you}[0m are saying there are n't Hollywood stars and starlets there , there is not a whole lot going on . 
(11) Just the howling wind and the pouring rain otherwise . 
(12) And a lot of fog [1m[32m{I}[0m guess now . 
(13) Apparently , it 's going to be hard to get a good camera angle for [1m[31m{the wedding}[0m . 
(14) Apparently so , yes , and [3m[33m{the guests}[0m have been warned not to keep cameras in [3m[33m{their}[0m kilts . 
(15) Cameras in [3m[33m{their}[0m kilts ? 
(16) Yes . 
(17) If one would so desire . 
(18) Well apparently , photo lens in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me . 
(19) Yes , [1m[34m{guests}[0m have been warned not to bring in cameras in [1m[34m{their}[0m kilts and [31m{people}[0m are having [31m{their}[0m kilts examined and looked up , which if you know anything about [1m[34m{Scotland}[0m and [34m{Scottish men}[0m are n't suppose to wear anything under [34m{their}[0m kilts . 
(20) Yeah . 
(21) A bit of an eyeful . 
(22) Yes , [1m[32m{I}[0m can . 
(23) He 's got a camera there ! 
(24) [4m[35m{That}[0m 's an interesting little anecdote , is n't [4m[35m{it}[0m ? 
(25) Well , when this sort of thing happens in a small community and [1m[32m{I}[0m guess that 's a under statement in this case , whether or not it all succeeds depends on how well some of the local people can keep secrets . 
(26) Are people kind of , you know , in the fold on this , or are there things being leaked around to press here and there ? 
(27) Well Skibo Castle , where [1m[31m{the wedding}[0m is being held , is very discrete . 
(28) There have been a lot of celebrity weddings there but none as big as [1m[31m{this}[0m admittedly . 
(29) But within [1m[35m{the town}[0m there was [1m[32m{a piano being rented out from a piano shop in Aberdeen , which is sort of reasonably nearby}[0m and it was leaked that [1m[32m{this}[0m [1m[33m{was}[0m the piano that someone was going to play at [1m[31m{the wedding}[0m . 
(30) Reportedly , it was Elton John who was going to play a song for [1m[35m{Guy}[0m and [4m[36m{the shop}[0m was inundated when [1m[33m{this}[0m was leaked and people just wanting to touch [1m[32m{the piano that was going to be in the same room as Madonna and Guy Ritchie}[0m . 
(31) [1m[32m{I}[0m imagine the locals could be kind of swooning for quite a while because [4m[33m{Sting , who I guess might be singing at the wedding}[0m , [4m[33m{his}[0m wife introduced [1m[36m{the couple}[0m . 
(32) Brad Pitt , Gwyneth Paltrow , Robin Williams , George Clooney , any other people around there are specially fond of ? 
(33) Well , [35m{I}[0m think that is the most unusual thing about it . 
(34) [35m{I}[0m mean [35m{I}[0m have some friends who live up in there next to the woods and people are just surprised that [1m[36m{they}[0m would choose [1m[35m{this little tiny village in Scotland}[0m . 
(35) It is the juxtaposition of that glamour , [35m{I}[0m mean a Gwyneth Paltrow in [3m[35m{Inverness}[0m . 
(36) It just does n't sound what they are thinking about . 
(37) And , of course , Stella McCartney is there too and apparently Celine Dion . 
(38) But it is pretty amazing , all these Hollywood stars in [1m[35m{this quiet , sleepy village that is n't really famous for anything}[0m . 
(39) So [3m[34m{this}[0m must be a real boom to the local economy ? 
(40) Oh absolutely , [35m{I}[0m mean it 's been estimated that [4m[34m{3 million pounds , which is about 5 million dollars ,}[0m will be made over the next few weeks in [1m[35m{Dornoch}[0m just from journalists and celebrities and sort of sightseers [35m{I}[0m guess coming to see where [33m{Madonna}[0m got [1m[31m{married}[0m . 
(41) Gosh , this must be you know about five thousand times the local budget there . 
(42) Yeah , absolutely . 
(43) [35m{I}[0m do n't think they 'll know what to do with [4m[34m{all that money}[0m out there . 
(44) There is only so many sheep you can buy . 
(45) But [1m[33m{the Scottish Tourist Board}[0m are also planning on cashing in on [3m[34m{it}[0m and [1m[33m{they}[0m 're estimating some 60 million dollars will be made over the next few years , just with people coming to see the sight of [1m[36m{Madonna and Guy 's}[0m wedding . 
(46) [35m{Garith McClain , covering the Madonna - Guy Ritchie wedding for the London based Guardian newspaper speaking to us from Edinburgh , Scotland .}[0m 
(47) Thank [35m{you}[0m , [35m{Garith}[0m . 
(48) Thank [1m[32m{you}[0m .
