(0) when [3m[34m{we}[0m come back did n't everyone in [4m[31m{the press}[0m [36m{say}[0m that [4m[36m{William Rehnquist}[0m was about to [1m[32m{retire}[0m as Cheif Justice /? 
(1) [3m[34m{We}[0m 'll ask [3m[35m{Woodward}[0m about [36m{that}[0m in a moment /. 
(2) Welcome back to [3m[34m{our}[0m conversation with [3m[35m{Bob Woodward}[0m /. 
(3) Speculation about [4m[36m{the cheif justice of the United States}[0m got out of control this past week /. 
(4) Many believe it 's just a matter of time before [4m[36m{Chief Justice William Rehnquist}[0m [1m[32m{steps}[0m down /. 
(5) [3m[36m{My}[0m source tells [3m[36m{me}[0m that [4m[36m{he}[0m is going to [1m[32m{retire}[0m and the time of [1m[32m{retiring}[0m is going to be as soon as the President is back in [1m[33m{the country}[0m as soon as Air Force One lands in [1m[33m{the country}[0m /. 
(6) What everyone believes and [35m{I}[0m guess [35m{I}[0m do agree with this is that [4m[36m{the Cheif Justice}[0m will now [1m[32m{step}[0m down this week , that there will be two vacancies /. 
(7) [4m[36m{Rehnquist}[0m of course now saying [4m[36m{he}[0m has no plans to ah [1m[32m{step}[0m down /. 
(8) was n't [1m[31m{this}[0m [4m[31m{the press}[0m that had speculated worse /? 
(9) Yeah [1m[31m{it}[0m was /. 
(10) and ah kind of stupidly so /. 
(11) Ah [3m[35m{I}[0m mean there is a way to say look [4m[36m{he}[0m 's ill /. 
(12) ah [1m[36m{people}[0m are claiming [1m[36m{they}[0m have inside information /. 
(13) but [3m[35m{I}[0m thought ah [4m[36m{Rehnquist}[0m said it best when [4m[34m{somebody}[0m asked [4m[36m{him}[0m recently and said it 's for [4m[36m{me}[0m to know and [4m[34m{you}[0m to find out /. 
(14) [3m[35m{I}[0m remember hearing that phrase first in third grade /. 
(15) /. 
(16) Now [3m[35m{you}[0m wrote [34m{a book about the Supreme Court the Brethren}[0m /. 
(17) At the time [4m[36m{Rehnquist}[0m was on [3m[31m{the Supreme Court}[0m /. 
(18) [1m[35m{five justices}[0m cooperated with [3m[35m{you}[0m [3m[35m{you}[0m 've said /. 
(19) [4m[36m{Rehnquist}[0m was one of [1m[35m{them}[0m /? 
(20) [3m[35m{I}[0m 'm not saying /. 
(21) [4m[32m{we}[0m do n't disclose [4m[32m{our}[0m sources /. 
(22) So there [3m[32m{'s}[0m still Deep Throats on [3m[31m{the court}[0m /? 
(23) [3m[32m{That}[0m 's right /. 
(24) and you know [4m[32m{we}[0m still protect sources who ah were justices or are justices perhaps /. 
(25) But [3m[35m{you}[0m have [1m[34m{Lewis Powell}[0m was one of [3m[35m{your}[0m sources because [1m[34m{he}[0m 's passed away /. 
(26) Yes yes [1m[34m{he}[0m 's deceased /. 
(27) and it 's very interesting having a [3m[31m{Supreme Court}[0m justice who 's a confidential source /. 
(28) Ah someday when [3m[35m{my}[0m notes on this are released you will see [3m[31m{Supreme Court}[0m justices saying come in the back door /. 
(29) ah ah do n't quote a Justice because somebody will say which son of a bitch talked /. 
(30) /. 
(31) Why do n't [32m{justices}[0m talk on the record /? 
(32) [31m{I}[0m mean [3m[31m{it}[0m 's this kind of secretive shadowy institution /. 
(33) Um should [32m{they}[0m give more interviews to people like [3m[35m{you}[0m /? 
(34) Oh of course oh yes /. 
(35) [3m[35m{I}[0m think we [33m{need}[0m more sunlight on all institutions /. 
(36) and [33m{that}[0m 's why Scott Armstrong and [3m[35m{I}[0m did [34m{the book ah on the Supreme Court}[0m /. 
(37) Ah people now realize that lots of the justices ' papers are avaliable how incredibly accurate and carefully [34m{that book}[0m was done /. 
(38) All right well [31m{I}[0m love the idea of [4m[35m{justices}[0m spinning [3m[35m{you}[0m on background at least trying to get [4m[35m{their}[0m version of the truth out /. 
(39) Ah just breifly ah [3m[33m{Mark Felt}[0m ah we were talking about [3m[33m{he}[0m 's made [3m[33m{his}[0m own book and movie deal /. 
(40) Ah can [3m[35m{you}[0m see [4m[33m{Tom Hanks}[0m playing Deep Throat in the next movie /? 
(41) Um anything 's possible /. 
(42) maybe [4m[33m{he}[0m 'll be playing Karl Rove in the next movie /. 
(43) who knows ah /. 
(44) Funny things happen /. 
(45) but [3m[35m{I}[0m think ah [3m[33m{Felt 's}[0m lawyer and family can do ah something that 's going to add to the record on all of this /. 
(46) All right we 'll wait and see /. 
(47) [3m[35m{Bob Woodward}[0m thanks for joining [3m[34m{us}[0m /. 
(48) Thank [31m{you}[0m /. 
(49) [3m[34m{We}[0m 'll be right back /.
