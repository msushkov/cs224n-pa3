(0) [1m[31m{Major League baseball 's National League champion New York Mets}[0m fortified [1m[31m{their}[0m teams ' leadership on [36m{Tuesday}[0m by resigning [34m{Manager Bobby Valentine}[0m and [1m[32m{General Manager Steve Phillips}[0m . 
(1) One of [1m[31m{the Mets '}[0m owners , Nelson Doubleday told a [1m[33m{New York}[0m newspaper that [34m{Valentine 's}[0m contract was for three years at $ 7.5 million and with [1m[32m{Phillips}[0m was for three years at $ 3 million . 
(2) [34m{The fifty - year - old Valentine}[0m replaced Dallas Green as [1m[31m{the Mets '}[0m manager on August 26th , 1996 . 
(3) Since then , [34m{he}[0m has led [1m[31m{the team}[0m to four consecutive winning seasons , including back - to - back post-season berths and [1m[31m{the franchise 's}[0m first trip to the World Series in 14 years . 
(4) [34m{Valentine}[0m said [34m{he}[0m knew [34m{he}[0m wanted to stay in [1m[33m{New York}[0m . 
(5) We think after the last game when Mike and Fonse and Alan John amongst the others , came in and literally asked [34m{me}[0m to stay , that [34m{I}[0m knew at that time , probably could have offered a lot less , that [34m{I}[0m was going to stay . 
(6) [34m{Valentine}[0m had been under [35m{contract}[0m through midnight [36m{Tuesday}[0m , while [1m[32m{Phillips}[0m was under contract through December . 
(7) By resigning [34m{Valentine}[0m before [34m{his}[0m contract expired , [1m[31m{the Mets}[0m avoided a bidding war for [34m{his}[0m services . 
(8) The Cincinnati Reds had expressed an interest in [34m{him}[0m and the Los Angeles Dodgers , Philadelphia Phillies , and Toronto Blue Jays are also without managers .
