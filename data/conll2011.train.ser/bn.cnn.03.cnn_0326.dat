(0) Welcome back . 
(1) Check in with [3m[31m{Jack Cafferty}[0m as we look at the fountains outside of time answer life . 
(2) We were talking about the road map to Middle East peace and ran [3m[36m{a footage about the chicken and these dogs}[0m . 
(3) There is [3m[36m{the picture}[0m . 
(4) [4m[32m{The golden retrieverr on the left}[0m had [1m[34m{a litter of pups}[0m and [1m[35m{the chicken}[0m got in the pen . 
(5) A real story , [3m[33m{they}[0m 're all hanging out . 
(6) It looks as though [3m[32m{the puppies in one of the shots}[0m is [1m[36m{trying}[0m to get lunch from [1m[35m{the chicken}[0m . 
(7) [1m[36m{That}[0m is what [3m[32m{they}[0m 're doing , [3m[31m{jack}[0m ! 
(8) We got a lot of e-mails to us on the East Coast who do n't know about the farm . 
(9) The answer is apparently , , you can not nurse a chicken . 
(10) [4m[31m{Bill .}[0m 
(11) There you go . 
(12) The question should be what is [1m[35m{the chicken}[0m getting out of this . 
(13) [3m[31m{I}[0m do n't want to go there . 
(14) I.K. in New Jersey a biology teacher , [3m[31m{I}[0m can tell you without hesitation , a chicken can not be nursed . 
(15) Only mammals that have distinct biological feature . 
(16) Chickens are also devoid of hen 's teeth , much to the satisfaction of [1m[34m{those little puppies}[0m . 
(17) You do n't -- city people ? 
(18) No . 
(19) Our viewers are nice , not nasty . 
(20) Here is the explanation . 
(21) This is the real deal . 
(22) Any farm kid knows that [3m[34m{certain animals}[0m can not see for a few days after [3m[34m{they}[0m 're born , including puppies . 
(23) [1m[34m{The puppies}[0m [3m[35m{try}[0m to nurse [1m[35m{the chicken hen}[0m . 
(24) [1m[34m{They}[0m do [3m[35m{that}[0m by feel , not sight . 
(25) A chicken hen is warm and comfortable , so [1m[34m{they}[0m try [1m[34m{their}[0m luck and eventually feel [1m[34m{their}[0m way back to [4m[32m{the mother dog where things work out better for them}[0m . 
(26) [4m[31m{I}[0m 'm so glad that 's cleared up . 
(27) We 'll get back to the --
