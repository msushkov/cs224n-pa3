(0) [1m[34m{I}[0m have [36m{a number of suggestions to help you through your national crisis over who should be the next President}[0m . 
(1) And [1m[34m{The World 's Eddie Mair}[0m has included [36m{them}[0m in [3m[31m{this week 's letter from London}[0m . 
(2) Normally [1m[34m{I}[0m would n't interfere in [4m[35m{your}[0m politics , at least not since [1m[31m{Hillary Clinton}[0m called [1m[34m{me}[0m and asked whether [1m[31m{she}[0m should stand in New York . 
(3) [1m[34m{I}[0m advised [1m[31m{her}[0m there was more chance of Rudy Giuliani being caught with another woman than there was of [1m[31m{her}[0m winning elected office . 
(4) But [4m[35m{your}[0m post-election dilemma leads [1m[34m{me}[0m to put forward a number of ideas to assist [4m[35m{you}[0m at this , the most critical moment Americans have faced since they changed the taste of Coke . 
(5) First of all , what about allowing [4m[33m{Clinton}[0m just to have a third time ? 
(6) [31m{We}[0m know [4m[33m{him}[0m , [4m[33m{he}[0m knows [31m{us}[0m , and it has never been dull . 
(7) What 's more , [4m[33m{he}[0m enjoys [4m[33m{his}[0m special relationship with Britain 's Tony Blair , and [4m[33m{he}[0m has formed special relationships with , well [4m[35m{you}[0m set [4m[35m{your}[0m own White House intern , joke here . 
(8) Another way of deciding who should be [4m[35m{your}[0m next leader is by [1m[36m{putting}[0m the word President in front of the candidate 's surnames . 
(9) If [4m[35m{you}[0m [1m[32m{say}[0m [4m[34m{President Gore}[0m , does [1m[32m{it}[0m send a shiver up [4m[35m{your}[0m spine ? and surely to goodness [31m{we}[0m 'll never have [4m[36m{a President Bush}[0m . 
(10) Certainly [1m[36m{that}[0m 's how [1m[34m{I}[0m am going to refer to [35m{them both}[0m for the rest of [3m[31m{this letter}[0m . 
(11) [1m[34m{I}[0m suggest [4m[35m{you}[0m try [1m[36m{it}[0m at home . 
(12) Alternatively , why not give the presidency to [1m[35m{the candidate who stands in front of the largest number of flags during his news conferences}[0m . 
(13) [35m{Both President Gore and President Bush}[0m have held a flurry of news conferences in recent weeks and with each one [35m{they}[0m have [1m[33m{increased}[0m the number of Stars and Stripes [35m{they}[0m use as a backdrop . 
(14) [1m[34m{I}[0m think [35m{they}[0m think [1m[33m{it}[0m makes [35m{them}[0m look patriotic and presidential . 
(15) Things got out of hand on [33m{Monday night when Al Gore appeared in front of what appeared to be a dozen Stars and Stripes}[0m . 
(16) [33m{It}[0m looked like an explosion in a flag factory . 
(17) [1m[34m{I}[0m stopped listening to what [4m[34m{he}[0m was saying and started wondering where this would end . 
(18) By tomorrow [1m[34m{I}[0m 'm confident [4m[36m{President Bush}[0m will be wearing a Stars and Stripes suit with matching tie , shoes , shirt and underwear . 
(19) On Friday , [4m[34m{Gore}[0m will come out with [4m[34m{his}[0m face painted in patriotic colors and by the weekend [4m[36m{George W. Bush}[0m would have changed [4m[36m{his}[0m name to ' America , ' just to prove how American [4m[36m{he}[0m really is . 
(20) Having said that [1m[34m{I}[0m saw [3m[32m{the Canadian Prime Minister}[0m celebrate [3m[32m{his}[0m re-election in front of a dozen Maple Leaves , but who cares about Canada . 
(21) [1m[34m{I}[0m 'm sorry if all of this sounds like [32m{a load of nonsense which undermines the entire principle of democracy}[0m . 
(22) [1m[34m{I}[0m know America would never really stand for [32m{that}[0m , would [4m[35m{you}[0m ? 
(23) Till next time , [4m[35m{yours}[0m truly , [1m[34m{Eddie Mair}[0m .
