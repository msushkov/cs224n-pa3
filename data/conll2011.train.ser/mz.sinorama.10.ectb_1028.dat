(0) Healthy money management 
(1) Chiu Shean - bii of National Taiwan University was told in a recent meeting with [4m[31m{the general manager of certain large American commercial bank}[0m : " Asians always ask : ' Is the market going to go up or down tomorrow ? ' 
(2) But [4m[32m{investment advisors}[0m are not weather forecasters , and [4m[32m{we}[0m do n't pretend that [4m[32m{we}[0m can know the future . " 
(3) [4m[31m{This banker}[0m says that [4m[31m{his}[0m money management target is not to make a specific profit within a specific time , but to use a variety of financial instruments - including defensive investments like insurance and reliable ones like savings , as well as an active investment portfolio - to appropriately diversify [4m[31m{his}[0m assets . 
(4) [4m[31m{He}[0m seeks to " build a Noah 's ark . 
(5) When the weather is good , you can make a little more progress , but when [4m[35m{storms}[0m hit , you can ride [4m[35m{them}[0m out . " 
(6) [4m[33m{Chen Yi - fen , who comes across all manner of money management plans every day ,}[0m often wonders about the meaning of it all . 
(7) [4m[33m{She}[0m says that today [4m[34m{banks}[0m are always talking about how [4m[34m{they}[0m want to provide every individual with tools to " intelligently manage money . " 
(8) For example , [4m[34m{they}[0m provide credit cards that award bonus points , housing loans with built - in short - term overdrafts for investment , and even mutual fund accounts that will automatically invest a specific amount at fixed times . 
(9) But how much money is enough ? 
(10) That depends on the values of the individual . 
(11) " [31m{Each individual}[0m should choose a lifestyle and belief system that [31m{they}[0m feel comfortable with , and not just follow the crowd , " says [4m[33m{Chen}[0m . 
(12) After all , in a pluralized society , there should be more than one definition of success . 
(13) Recently there was a news story about [3m[36m{the old author Chang Tuo - wu}[0m having to sell lottery tickets on the street . 
(14) One financial expert took [3m[36m{Chang}[0m as an object lesson to " warn " [4m[36m{people}[0m to learn how to manage [4m[36m{their}[0m money . 
(15) Yet , looking at this another way , if [3m[36m{Chang}[0m had spent [3m[36m{his}[0m youth worrying about accumulating money , [3m[36m{he}[0m would not have had the experiences [3m[36m{he}[0m did and made [3m[36m{his}[0m way from being an ordinary soldier to writing such moving works . 
(16) In the end , there are no numbers that can validly measure what has been gained in life , and what lost . 
(17) It is said that the two biggest causes of family arguments this year have been differences over who to vote for in the presidential election , and over what stocks to buy . 
(18) As Jessica Liu reminds us , money management , like [32m{life itself}[0m , is an accumulation of small experiences , a long road with ups and downs , and so should be faced with equanimity . 
(19) After all , is n't the point of making money to have a better life ? 
(20) But if you lose your sense of fun , your health , or your friends and family in the process , and if you win the money game only at the cost of losing the game of life , what kind of a return on your investment is that ?
