(3) Here 's what they 're basing [35m{it}[0m on , the newest `` Washington Post '' / ABC News poll showing a 50 % , 46 % race . 
(4) Much closer , however nrk [4m[33m{our}[0m own tracking poll , a statistical dead heat at 43 % , 42 % . 
(5) But the trend line is clear . 
(6) Over the past several days , [36m{Gore 's}[0m loss is quite literally [33m{Bush 's}[0m gain . 
(7) So the stakes could tpwhot higher .

(12) [32m{Tennessee}[0m is a fine place to live , [33m{I}[0m guess it depends , though , on who your landlord is . 
(13) Both sides have gone negative , but advisors say [33m{Bush}[0m will avoid getting personally involved for fear of a backlash , leaving [33m{his}[0m top aides to attack [36m{Gore}[0m by calling [36m{him}[0m a serial exaggerator .

(21) [4m[35m{Advisors}[0m maintain such gaffes are hardly decisive that the election will turn on a general comfort level that undecided voters have with [4m[36m{both candidates}[0m , terrain where [4m[35m{they}[0m believe [33m{Bush}[0m still has an advantage . 
(22) [4m[34m{David Gregory}[0m , [4m[33m{NBC News}[0m , with the [33m{Bush}[0m campaign in Greensboro , [1m[31m{North Carolina}[0m .
