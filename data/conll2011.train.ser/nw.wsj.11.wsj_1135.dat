(0) [4m[31m{The Bush administration}[0m said [4m[31m{it}[0m is submitting [4m[35m{a `` comprehensive '' proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations}[0m . 
(1) [4m[35m{The proposal}[0m reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade - distorting subsidies on farm products . 
(2) But [4m[35m{it}[0m would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved . 
(3) [4m[35m{The U.S. plan}[0m also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . 
(4) [36m{Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal ,}[0m said [36m{she}[0m is confident [4m[35m{it}[0m will gain considerable support from [4m[32m{the U.S. 's}[0m trading partners . 
(5) [33m{Mr. Yeutter}[0m , seeking to allay European objections to [32m{an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm - trade barriers by the year 2000}[0m , said [4m[35m{the new U.S. proposal}[0m would n't `` put [34m{farmers}[0m out of business '' but would only encourage [34m{them}[0m to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . '' 
(6) [4m[32m{The U.S.}[0m is submitting [4m[35m{the proposal}[0m today in Geneva , hoping that [4m[35m{the initiative}[0m will spur [1m[31m{members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade}[0m to reach agreement on new trade rules before [1m[31m{their}[0m current negotiating round concludes in December 1990 . 
(7) Another U.S. proposal filed Monday urges more `` fair play '' in services trade , including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies . 
(8) Unlike [32m{the earlier U.S. farm - trade proposal which struck European countries as too extreme}[0m , [4m[35m{the latest plan}[0m would provide some room for maneuver . 
(9) For instance , [4m[35m{the new U.S. package}[0m makes clear there would be a transition period during which [4m[34m{GATT}[0m members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion [35m{their}[0m farmers from foreign competition . 
(10) [4m[35m{It}[0m also says [31m{countries}[0m could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if [31m{they}[0m experience an unusually heavy volume of imports . 
(11) Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies , as [32m{the earlier U.S. proposal}[0m did , [4m[35m{the new package}[0m calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones . 
(12) Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints , and others with a `` relatively minor trade impact '' would be allowed to continue under certain conditions . 
(13) [4m[35m{The new U.S. plan}[0m also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily . 
(14) The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by [4m[33m{the European Community 's current attempt to bar imports of beef from hormone - treated U.S. cattle}[0m . 
(15) [4m[32m{The U.S.}[0m contends that [4m[33m{the rules}[0m are n't justified on health grounds . 
(16) To encourage more competition among exporting countries , [4m[32m{the U.S.}[0m is proposing that export subsidies , including tax incentives for exporters , be phased out in five years .
