(0) A net worth of $ 300 million . 
(1) Anyone who knows [35m{me}[0m knows [35m{my}[0m obsession with [3m[31m{tween stars}[0m . 
(2) [3m[31m{They}[0m 're kids eight to 14 , and for [36m{millions}[0m , [36m{their}[0m heroes barely occupy puberty . 
(3) The reason for [35m{my}[0m obsession is simple , deep seething jealousy . 
(4) It is n't enough for [3m[31m{these tween stars}[0m to be on the TV or movie . 
(5) [3m[31m{They}[0m want to own [31m{every form of media}[0m and want to own [31m{it}[0m now . 
(6) Unlike the Corey Feldman of the ' 80s , today 's tweens are n't content with succeeding in just one of medium . 
(7) [3m[36m{Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen}[0m started [3m[35m{it all}[0m . 
(8) Now [3m[36m{they}[0m have a billion dollar empire built on videos , clothing perfume and more . 
(9) And then there 's [1m[34m{the tween Hilary Duff}[0m . 
(10) Fans know [1m[34m{her}[0m as Lizzie Maguire . 
(11) Movies , books , albums . 
(12) Three corporate giants head the way . 
(13) Typical , Nickelodeon or Disney starts [3m[31m{them}[0m off . 
(14) Then when [3m[31m{they}[0m 're ready to breed [3m[31m{they}[0m go to the WB . 
(15) Why [1m[35m{such a focus on these tween stars}[0m ? 
(16) [1m[35m{It}[0m has little to do with [3m[31m{their}[0m artistic vision . 
(17) [1m[31m{One star}[0m told [4m[34m{Vanity Fair}[0m [1m[31m{their}[0m favorite author is whoever wrote the Bible . 
(18) [3m[31m{These kids}[0m are at that magical age when new multibillion declare spending power is put in service of intense peer pressure leading to brand loyalties that can last a lifetime . 
(19) [4m[33m{The flip side between stars}[0m , though , is once the fans grow up [3m[31m{their}[0m star power may dim . 
(20) Do n't believe [4m[33m{it}[0m just ask one of the Coreys . 
(21) [3m[31m{These tweens}[0m are everywhere . 
(22) [3m[31m{They}[0m 're right on the cover of [4m[34m{Vanity Fair}[0m . 
(23) Tweens are all over [4m[34m{it}[0m . 
(24) That 's the issue right there . 
(25) So [4m[35m{we}[0m have with [4m[35m{us}[0m [4m[34m{Vanity Fair}[0m Fashion Director Elizabeth Olsen . 
(26) [35m{I}[0m was shocked when [35m{I}[0m saw [4m[34m{them}[0m cover [3m[31m{the tweens}[0m . 
(27) Why are [3m[31m{they}[0m so important ? 
(28) [3m[31m{They}[0m 're important because [4m[34m{we}[0m report on what 's happening . 
(29) [4m[34m{We}[0m report on the culture of what 's now , what makes money , what the buzz is , what 's next . 
(30) And [3m[31m{they}[0m 're making a lot of money . 
(31) A much more than a lot of money . 
(32) Unlike stars of the past , [3m[31m{they}[0m really are not content to be singers or dancers , [3m[31m{they}[0m are like [4m[31m{Omnimedia , mini Martha Stewart}[0m . 
(33) [3m[31m{They}[0m 're more than [4m[31m{that}[0m , actually , because [3m[31m{they}[0m have a television show to back [3m[31m{themselves}[0m up , then the movie , then the clothing line . 
(34) [3m[31m{They}[0m have much more and reach a much broader audience as well . 
(35) [35m{I}[0m saw [3m[32m{one}[0m interviewed , and [3m[32m{they}[0m said , Yeah , when [3m[32m{I}[0m left The Cosby Show at age four , [3m[32m{I}[0m cut an album at age five . 
(36) What happened to being kids ? 
(37) That was the great thing about the photo shoot . 
(38) [3m[31m{They}[0m 're still young , ambitious , excited , [3m[31m{they}[0m play dressup and have pillow fights . 
(39) Who 's the ultimate tween ? 
(40) you have to talk about [1m[34m{Hilary Duff}[0m , and you have to talk about [3m[36m{the Olsen twins}[0m . 
(41) Because [3m[36m{the Olsen twins}[0m started [3m[35m{it all}[0m . 
(42) [3m[36m{They}[0m created [3m[35m{it}[0m , maybe . 
(43) [3m[36m{They}[0m more than started [3m[35m{it}[0m . 
(44) And [3m[36m{they}[0m started prenatal . 
(45) But [3m[36m{they}[0m turned [3m[35m{it}[0m into an empire , what [33m{Shirley Temple}[0m could have done . 
(46) Had [33m{she}[0m only known . 
(47) [35m{I}[0m think [3m[36m{their}[0m company is called Dual Star . 
(48) Like a gross of a billion dollars last year . 
(49) [3m[36m{They}[0m work hard . 
(50) [3m[36m{They}[0m 're not just sitting there hiring people to do [3m[36m{their}[0m business . 
(51) [3m[36m{They}[0m do [3m[36m{their}[0m own business , and [3m[36m{they}[0m 're well - rounded and polite people . 
(52) Are [3m[36m{they}[0m nice ? 
(53) [3m[36m{They}[0m [4m[32m{'re}[0m so nice and cool . 
(54) How about [4m[32m{that}[0m ? 
(55) [3m[36m{They}[0m [1m[32m{'re}[0m actually very , very cool . 
(56) [35m{I}[0m 'm not sure of [1m[32m{that}[0m . 
(57) And [1m[34m{Hilary Duff}[0m is a star , and [34m{I}[0m guarantee [35m{you}[0m , [32m{they}[0m will grace [32m{their}[0m own cover . 
(58) Do [3m[31m{they all}[0m have [1m[33m{staying power}[0m ? 
(59) One ca n't predict that [3m[31m{all}[0m have [1m[33m{it}[0m , but some have [1m[33m{it}[0m . 
(60) It depends on who 's managing it , what career choices [3m[33m{they}[0m make , what [3m[33m{their}[0m parents help [3m[33m{them}[0m to do . 
(61) It would be interesting to see the audience that sort of adores [3m[31m{them}[0m now , whether --
