(0) [33m{Federal Reserve}[0m critics used to complain of `` stop and go '' monetary policies . 
(1) [4m[36m{They}[0m claimed that [33m{the Fed}[0m would first give a green light to [1m[31m{the economy}[0m by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt . 
(2) But under [4m[33m{Alan Greenspan}[0m that has changed . 
(3) [4m[33m{A supremely cautious man}[0m , [4m[33m{the Fed chairman}[0m is forever blinking yellow . 
(4) Indeed , [4m[33m{his}[0m caution has become legendary within the government . 
(5) [4m[33m{He}[0m fusses endlessly over [36m{economic statistics}[0m , dissecting [36m{them}[0m in dozens of ways , probing for hours in search of potential problems . 
(6) After thoroughly digesting reams of information , [4m[33m{he}[0m often concludes that more data are needed , and when [4m[33m{he}[0m finally decides to act , [4m[33m{his}[0m movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small . 
(7) Such caution was evident after [31m{the recent Friday - the - 13th stock market plunge}[0m . 
(8) Some [1m[33m{Bush}[0m administration officials urged [4m[33m{Mr. Greenspan}[0m to make an immediate public announcement of [4m[33m{his}[0m plans to provide ample credit to [3m[36m{the markets}[0m . 
(9) But [4m[33m{he}[0m [35m{refused}[0m , claiming that [4m[33m{he}[0m wanted to see what happened Monday morning before making any public statement . 
(10) [4m[33m{Mr. Greenspan 's}[0m decision to keep quiet also prompted a near - mutiny within [33m{the Fed 's}[0m ranks . 
(11) [3m[33m{A `` senior Fed official ''}[0m spoke on Saturday after [31m{the market swoon}[0m to both the Washington Post and the New York Times , [4m[31m{saying}[0m [33m{the Fed}[0m was prepared to provide as much credit as [3m[36m{the markets}[0m needed . 
(12) [4m[31m{The statement}[0m angered [4m[33m{Chairman Greenspan}[0m , but [4m[31m{it}[0m was greeted with applause by [3m[35m{the Bush administration}[0m and [3m[36m{the financial markets}[0m . 
(13) And , while [3m[33m{the mutinous Fed member}[0m has n't gone public , some [33m{Fed}[0m governors , most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , are known to have disagreed with [4m[33m{the chairman 's}[0m decision to remain silent . 
(14) Ironically , [3m[33m{the anonymous official 's}[0m comments have earned some plaudits for [4m[33m{Mr. Greenspan , who is mistakenly seen as the source}[0m . 
(15) At a hearing [3m[31m{last week}[0m , Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told [3m[32m{Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady}[0m that [4m[33m{`` Chairman Greenspan 's ''}[0m announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a `` very important statement . '' 
(16) [3m[32m{Mr. Brady}[0m hesitantly replied that [3m[32m{he}[0m was n't sure whether [4m[33m{Mr. Greenspan}[0m `` made a statement [4m[33m{himself}[0m , or whether [4m[31m{that}[0m was a newspaper report . '' 
(17) [4m[33m{The Fed chairman 's}[0m caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after [31m{the market 's plunge}[0m , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid [3m[36m{the markets}[0m . 
(18) A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system . 
(19) And , by the end of that week , the key federal funds interest rate , which is largely controlled by [33m{the Fed}[0m , had settled at 8.75 % , barely changed from the level of just under 9 % that prevailed the previous week . 
(20) [1m[33m{Bush}[0m administration officials appear increasingly concerned that [4m[33m{Mr. Greenspan}[0m is cautious to a fault . 
(21) Signs of growing weakness in [1m[31m{the economy}[0m , paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control , have caused [34m{them}[0m to wonder why [4m[33m{the Fed chairman}[0m is so grudging in reducing rates . 
(22) Those concerns are n't expressed in public . 
(23) In fact , [3m[35m{the administration}[0m and [33m{the Fed}[0m have been going out of [1m[32m{their}[0m way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that [1m[32m{they}[0m are at odds , fearing stories about an [33m{administration - Fed}[0m split added to the stock market 's jitters . 
(24) Still , the split is there . 
(25) [3m[35m{The administration 's}[0m concerns are understandable . 
(26) [1m[31m{The economy}[0m is showing signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers . 
(27) Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled . 
(28) Factory payrolls and production fell in September , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch . 
(29) But [4m[33m{Mr. Greenspan}[0m [32m{remains}[0m reluctant to loosen policy , partly because [4m[33m{he}[0m faces a phalanx of presidents of regional [33m{Fed}[0m banks who oppose credit easing . 
(30) In addition , [4m[33m{the chairman}[0m has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road . 
(31) Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5 % . 
(32) But if [33m{the Fed}[0m eases too soon , [4m[33m{Mr. Greenspan}[0m fears , prices may begin to accelerate again next year . 
(33) Moreover , if [33m{the Fed}[0m holds tight , [33m{it}[0m may be able gradually to reduce inflation , moving toward the zero - inflation goal that [4m[33m{the Fed chairman}[0m embraced in testimony to [4m[35m{Congress}[0m [3m[31m{last week}[0m . 
(34) So far , [4m[33m{Mr. Greenspan 's}[0m cautious approach to policy has served both [4m[33m{him}[0m and [4m[34m{the nation}[0m well . 
(35) [4m[33m{His}[0m hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why [1m[31m{the economy next month}[0m seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession . 
(36) `` [4m[34m{We}[0m 've gotten through two stock market crashes , and [4m[34m{we}[0m 've gone through an election without any major problems , '' says [4m[32m{David Hale , an economist of Kemper Financial Services}[0m . 
(37) `` [4m[32m{I}[0m think you have to give [4m[33m{Greenspan}[0m a good rating . '' 
(38) But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes . 
(39) [33m{The Fed 's}[0m reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for [1m[34m{a new recession , perhaps starting early next year}[0m . 
(40) If [1m[34m{that}[0m happens , [4m[33m{Chairman Greenspan}[0m could well become an open target . 
(41) Already , [4m[35m{Congress}[0m is toying with legislation to curb [33m{the Fed 's}[0m independence . 
(42) If [1m[31m{the economy}[0m turns down , such proposals could gain strong momentum .
