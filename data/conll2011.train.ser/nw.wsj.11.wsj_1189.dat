(0) [4m[36m{Savings and loans}[0m [1m[35m{reject}[0m blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as [4m[36m{they}[0m reject whites , [32m{the Office of Thrift Supervision}[0m said . 
(1) But [1m[35m{that}[0m does n't necessarily mean thrifts are discriminating against blacks , [32m{the agency}[0m said . 
(2) [32m{The office , an arm of the Treasury ,}[0m said [32m{it}[0m does n't have [4m[31m{data on the financial position of applicants}[0m and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often . 
(3) Nevertheless , on Capitol Hill , where the information was released yesterday at [4m[32m{a Senate banking subcommittee hearing}[0m , [3m[32m{lawmakers}[0m said [3m[32m{they}[0m are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities . 
(4) [3m[32m{They}[0m asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws . 
(5) [3m[34m{Sen. Alan Dixon -LRB- D , Ill. -RRB- , chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs ,}[0m said , `` [3m[34m{I}[0m 'm not a statistician . 
(6) But when [3m[31m{blacks}[0m are getting [3m[31m{their}[0m loan applications [1m[35m{rejected}[0m twice as often as whites -- and in some cities , [1m[35m{it}[0m is three and four times as often -- [3m[34m{I}[0m conclude that discrimination is part of [1m[35m{the problem}[0m . '' 
(7) [1m[31m{James Grohl , a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions ,}[0m said , `` The data is a red flag , but lacking [4m[31m{the financial data}[0m you ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread . '' 
(8) [1m[31m{The trade group official}[0m added : `` Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at [4m[31m{it}[0m . '' 
(9) [3m[34m{Sen. Dixon}[0m held [4m[32m{the hearing}[0m to follow up on a provision in [4m[33m{the savings and loan bailout bill}[0m that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending . 
(10) [4m[33m{The legislation}[0m also requires [33m{broad new disclosures of the race , sex and income level of borrowers}[0m , but [33m{that information}[0m wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least . 
(11) [35m{The Federal Reserve}[0m said [35m{its}[0m studies in recent years , which adjust for income differences and other variables , showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites . 
(12) But [3m[35m{John LaWare , a Fed governor ,}[0m told [1m[32m{the subcommittee}[0m the evidence is mixed and that [35m{the Fed 's}[0m believes the vast majority of banks are n't discriminating . 
(13) For instance , [3m[35m{he}[0m noted , [4m[32m{the Fed studies}[0m have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites . 
(14) Several lawmakers were angered that [1m[36m{the bank and thrift regulators}[0m generally said [1m[36m{they}[0m have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination . 
(15) `` [32m{We}[0m would be the first to admit that [32m{we}[0m have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years '' to developing examinations for discrimination , said [31m{Jonathan Fiechter , a top official of the Office of Thrift Supervision}[0m . 
(16) `` If we 've [3m[36m{got}[0m folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly , '' said Sen. Donald Riegle -LRB- D. , Mich. -RRB- , chairman of the banking committee , `` then [3m[36m{that}[0m is a matter that needs remedy now , not six months from now , or six years from now , or 26 years from now . '' 
(17) Officials of [36m{the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.}[0m and [4m[34m{the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency}[0m said [3m[33m{they}[0m have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws . 
(18) [36m{The FDIC}[0m said [36m{it}[0m has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices . 
(19) [4m[34m{The comptroller 's office}[0m said [4m[34m{it}[0m found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987 . 
(20) [4m[34m{The comptroller 's office}[0m also said that of 37,000 complaints [4m[34m{it}[0m received since January 1987 , [34m{only 16}[0m alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending . 
(21) [4m[34m{The agency}[0m investigated [34m{the complaints}[0m but no violations were cited . 
(22) [4m[35m{Thrift regulators}[0m did n't give any figures on [4m[35m{their}[0m enforcement actions . 
(23) [31m{Mr. Fiechter}[0m said that among the possibilities being considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of `` testers '' -- government investigators who would pose as home buyers . 
(24) The Department of Housing and Urban Development has used testers to investigate discrimination in rental housing . 
(25) [1m[33m{Using}[0m testers could be controversial with financial institutions , but [1m[31m{Mr. Grohl}[0m said [1m[34m{the U.S. League of Savings Institutions}[0m had n't yet taken any position on [1m[33m{the matter}[0m .
