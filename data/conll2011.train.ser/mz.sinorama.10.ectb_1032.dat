(0) Another way people in [3m[33m{Taiwan}[0m can actively participate in international affairs is by encouraging [3m[35m{people of ability and influence in society}[0m to apply to join [3m[34m{the UN 's}[0m own NGOs , such as population , human rights , peace and environmental groups , so that [3m[35m{they}[0m can contribute [3m[35m{their}[0m knowledge , and at the same time let others better understand people from [3m[33m{Taiwan}[0m . 
(1) We are living in an age of people power , and [3m[34m{the UN}[0m is responding to the trends of our time . 
(2) In the past , [3m[31m{NGOs}[0m merely played a monitoring role at [3m[34m{the UN}[0m , but now the trend is towards [3m[31m{their}[0m involvement in policy implementation . 
(3) Hence in our future approach to [3m[34m{the UN}[0m , besides continuing to press for admission by mobilizing our diplomatic partners to speak on our behalf , we should also actively seek to make the most of the power of our people . 
(4) In particular , in the age of [3m[36m{the Internet}[0m , universal values such as humanitarianism and human rights transcend the narrow confines of national boundaries and nationalism . 
(5) The Taiwan issue is one of basic human rights . 
(6) In other words , the people of [3m[33m{Taiwan}[0m are being denied the right to speak and vote in international affairs . 
(7) We can use [3m[36m{the Internet}[0m to gain the support of international champions of justice . 
(8) Furthermore , among Taiwanese compatriots living overseas there are [4m[31m{many who opposed the old government , but are willing to support the new}[0m . 
(9) [4m[31m{These people}[0m are excellent partners through whom we can participate in [3m[34m{UN}[0m NGOs . 
(10) We should n't be afraid of [3m[32m{the Chinese communist regime 's}[0m attempts to suppress such activity 
(11) . 
(12) [3m[32m{They}[0m wo n't last forever , and [3m[32m{they}[0m ca n't discourage everyone who supports us .
