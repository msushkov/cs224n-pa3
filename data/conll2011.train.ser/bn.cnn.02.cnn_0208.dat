(0) [32m{His}[0m plight has been publicized worldwide , and tonight [32m{a 12 - year - old Iraqi boy who lost his arms during a missile attack}[0m is [3m[31m{being}[0m treated at a hospital in [1m[33m{Kuwait}[0m . 
(1) Here 's [1m[36m{Andrea with more on his story}[0m . 
(2) Reporter : 
(3) [3m[31m{This}[0m is what [32m{12 - year - old Ali}[0m has been asking for , what [32m{his}[0m doctors have been praying for , and what the outside world has been demanding . 
(4) Finally , [3m[32m{U.S. Marines}[0m arrived at the hospital where [32m{Ali}[0m has survived since [32m{his}[0m horrific injuries 18 days ago . 
(5) [3m[32m{They}[0m 're here to take [32m{him}[0m to [1m[33m{Kuwait}[0m and to a specialist burns unit . 
(6) When [32m{Ali}[0m awoke this morning , [32m{he}[0m could scarcely believe that [35m{today}[0m would really be the day when [32m{he}[0m would be taken abroad for the treatment [32m{he}[0m so desperately needs . 
(7) [32m{He}[0m was hopeful , and [32m{his}[0m eyes were bright . 
(8) [32m{He}[0m talked to [1m[36m{me}[0m about football , and [32m{his}[0m favorite players . 
(9) [1m[31m{Friends and relatives}[0m arrived [35m{today}[0m . 
(10) For [31m{some}[0m , this was the first time [31m{they}[0m had been able to see [32m{him}[0m since [1m[32m{the explosion that killed his mother , father , brothers and cousins}[0m . 
(11) [1m[31m{They}[0m were horrified by [32m{his}[0m injuries and pleaded for [32m{him}[0m to get specialist treatment outside Iraq . 
(12) [32m{His}[0m doctor , too , is grateful that [32m{Ali}[0m is getting [3m[31m{this chance}[0m . 
(13) [33m{I}[0m welcomed any real help to take [32m{him}[0m to a special unit abroad , and where [32m{he}[0m can take good care . 
(14) I am [1m[34m{the only hospital working now in Baghdad}[0m . 
(15) Reporter : 
(16) And [1m[34m{the hospital}[0m is becoming increasingly tense . 
(17) Armed men now roam the wards . 
(18) Fighters , too , are being treated here . 
(19) [1m[34m{It}[0m 's woefully overcrowded and chaotic . 
(20) In [34m{these conditions}[0m , it 's a miracle [32m{Ali}[0m has survived here at all . 
(21) The part of each day [32m{Ali}[0m dreads is when [32m{his}[0m amputation wounds and burns must be washed and dressed . 
(22) In [34m{these primitive conditions}[0m , without drugs , [1m[35m{the pain}[0m is excruciating for [32m{Ali}[0m , and far too traumatic to film . 
(23) Putting [32m{a little boy}[0m through [1m[35m{such agony}[0m reduces [32m{his}[0m doctor to tears . 
(24) Mercifully [35m{today}[0m this will be the last time [1m[35m{it}[0m will happen to [32m{Ali}[0m . 
(25) Tonight [32m{this little boy who has lost so much and been so brave}[0m is finally going to --
