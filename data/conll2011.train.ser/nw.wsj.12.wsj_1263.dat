(0) The management turnover at [3m[34m{Reebok International Ltd.}[0m continued with the resignation of [4m[32m{company president C. Joseph LaBonte , who joined Reebok just two years ago}[0m . 
(1) [4m[32m{Mr. LaBonte 's}[0m departure follows by two months the resignation of [3m[35m{Mark Goldston}[0m as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at [3m[34m{Reebok}[0m . 
(2) The resignations by [32m{the two executives , considered hard - charging and abrasive by Reebok insiders ,}[0m reflect a difference in style with [4m[34m{Paul Fireman , chairman and chief executive}[0m , according to several former executives . 
(3) [32m{The two executives}[0m are among a number of outsiders recruited by [3m[34m{Reebok}[0m in the past few years to help [3m[34m{it}[0m make the transition from a small start - up company to a marketing giant with sales [3m[36m{last year}[0m of $ 1.79 billion . 
(4) The changes come as [3m[34m{Reebok , which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late ,}[0m is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic - shoe business against rivals Nike Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc . 
(5) [4m[35m{The departures}[0m , said [4m[33m{Alice Ruth , an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco ,}[0m should enable [3m[34m{the company}[0m to focus on business issues instead of management differences . 
(6) `` [4m[33m{I}[0m think it 's more an issue of style . 
(7) [4m[33m{I}[0m would view it as a net positive . 
(8) [3m[34m{The company}[0m can go about [3m[34m{its}[0m business . 
(9) [3m[34m{They}[0m 're in the midst of a turnaround , '' [4m[33m{she}[0m noted . 
(10) Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20 % decline [3m[36m{last year}[0m . 
(11) A former executive agreed that [4m[35m{the departures}[0m do n't reflect major problems , adding : `` If you see [31m{any company that grows as fast as Reebok did}[0m , [31m{it}[0m is going to have people coming and going . '' 
(12) [3m[34m{Reebok}[0m said [4m[32m{Mr. LaBonte}[0m will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc. , a California - based venture capital firm that [4m[32m{he}[0m [4m[36m{founded}[0m in 1983 . 
(13) Before [4m[36m{that}[0m [4m[32m{he}[0m was president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Century - Fox Film Corp . 
(14) [3m[34m{Reebok}[0m added that [4m[34m{Mr. Fireman}[0m will assume the title of president . 
(15) [4m[31m{A spokesman}[0m said that neither [4m[34m{Mr. Fireman}[0m nor [4m[32m{Mr. LaBonte}[0m would be available for comment . 
(16) `` [3m[34m{We}[0m will not be commenting beyond the news release , '' [4m[31m{the spokesman}[0m said . 
(17) [3m[35m{Mr. Goldston , who had been president of Faberge Inc. 's Faberge U.S.A. division before joining Reebok in September 1988 ,}[0m left in August to pursue other interests .
