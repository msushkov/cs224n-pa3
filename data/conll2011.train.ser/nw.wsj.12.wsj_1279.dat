(0) [3m[32m{Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp}[0m called on [3m[34m{the Federal Reserve System}[0m to lower interest rates . 
(1) In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association , [3m[32m{Mr. Kemp}[0m broke the administration 's public silence on [3m[34m{the Fed}[0m and complained that `` interest rates are too high . '' 
(2) `` [3m[32m{I}[0m am convinced that [3m[33m{a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4 % or 5 %}[0m would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in [4m[31m{America}[0m , the refurbishing of our industrial system , [3m[33m{it}[0m would help the Third World economies considerably and [3m[33m{it}[0m would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' [3m[32m{Mr. Kemp}[0m said . 
(3) [3m[34m{The Fed}[0m recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to 8 3/4 % from about 9 % . 
(4) [3m[35m{Bush administration officials}[0m say inflation is under control . 
(5) With economic growth slowing , [3m[35m{they}[0m say [3m[35m{they}[0m [3m[36m{believe}[0m [3m[34m{the Fed}[0m should ease credit even further . 
(6) But for the most part , officials have avoided expressing [3m[36m{those views}[0m in public , fearing [3m[36m{they}[0m would unnecessarily antagonize [3m[34m{the Fed}[0m .
