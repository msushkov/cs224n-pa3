(0) [4m[33m{The government}[0m said [4m[33m{it}[0m would streamline [4m[33m{its}[0m enormous and often - criticized food marketing and distribution network , Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares , or Conasupo . 
(1) [4m[35m{Conasupo}[0m Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez said [4m[35m{the agency}[0m will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food - production plants and warehouses beginning early next year . 
(2) [4m[35m{The agency}[0m will withdraw from the production of nine food products , maintaining production of the two most important ones , corn and milk . 
(3) Mr. Ovalle also said [4m[35m{Conasupo}[0m will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods . 
(4) [4m[35m{The agency 's}[0m workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale . 
(5) [4m[35m{Conasupo}[0m controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at state - subsidized prices . 
(6) Business leaders have long criticized [4m[35m{the agency}[0m as a leading example of bureacratic waste . 
(7) Private - sector leaders praised [4m[34m{the Conasupo restructuring}[0m . 
(8) But most economists doubt [4m[34m{the streamlining}[0m would cut deeply into [4m[35m{Conasupo}[0m government subsidy , which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk .
