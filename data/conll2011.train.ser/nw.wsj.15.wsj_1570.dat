(0) AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County , Miss. , [3m[33m{Allen D. Tharp of Isola}[0m was one of the best known and most enterprising . 
(1) [3m[33m{He}[0m sold quarter - inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds , and [3m[33m{he}[0m bought back one - pound - or - so food - fish that [3m[33m{he}[0m `` live - hauled '' to market along with [3m[33m{his}[0m own whiskery crop . 
(2) And [3m[33m{he}[0m nearly always bought and sold for cash . 
(3) Along the way , [3m[33m{Mr. Tharp}[0m omitted a total of $ 1.5 million from [3m[33m{his}[0m receipts reported on [3m[35m{federal tax returns for three years}[0m . 
(4) [3m[35m{The returns}[0m landed in the hands of [3m[34m{an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator , Samuel James Baker}[0m . 
(5) [3m[34m{Mr. Baker}[0m interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers , live - haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with [3m[36m{detailed estimates of purchases and sales , in pounds and dollars , by Mr. Tharp and others}[0m . 
(6) Unknown to [3m[33m{Mr. Tharp}[0m , [3m[33m{he}[0m had fouled [3m[33m{his}[0m net on a special [1m[35m{IRS}[0m project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes . 
(7) Confronted with [3m[36m{the evidence}[0m , [3m[33m{Mr. Tharp}[0m pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison . 
(8) [3m[33m{He}[0m also owes a lot of back taxes , interest and civil fraud penalties . 
(9) A lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think . 
(10) Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation , on the basis of occupation , high income , type of income , or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions . 
(11) Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters : dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off . 
(12) Mail - order ministers have been squelched . 
(13) Now , television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny . 
(14) [1m[35m{The IRS}[0m recently won part of [1m[35m{its}[0m long - running battle with [33m{the Church of Scientology}[0m over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that [1m[34m{members '}[0m payments to [33m{the church}[0m were n't deductible because [1m[34m{the members}[0m received services in return . 
(15) [1m[35m{IRS}[0m statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used - car dealers , entertainment producers , masons , roofers , and taxi owners . 
(16) Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income , [1m[35m{the IRS}[0m has said . 
(17) Once such abuses become so pervasive , [1m[35m{the IRS}[0m builds another factor into [1m[35m{its}[0m secret computer formula for selecting [3m[36m{returns}[0m for audit and does n't need special projects for [3m[36m{them}[0m . 
(18) [4m[32m{San Franciscans}[0m have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of [4m[32m{them}[0m score high under [35m{that formula}[0m , not because [1m[35m{IRS}[0m agents envy [4m[32m{their}[0m life styles . 
(19) [4m[33m{Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices ,}[0m have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close [4m[33m{them}[0m . 
(20) Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals . 
(21) And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled [1m[35m{the IRS}[0m to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form - letter inquiries to taxpayers . 
(22) Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony -LRB- who gets a deduction -RRB- must report the former spouse 's [32m{Social Security}[0m number . 
(23) Passport applicants now must give [32m{Social Security}[0m numbers , enabling [1m[35m{the IRS}[0m to see whether [32m{Americans living abroad}[0m are filing required U.S. returns . 
(24) But while [1m[35m{IRS}[0m computers focus routinely on target groups like [32m{these}[0m , [1m[35m{the agency}[0m has assigned many agents to [4m[33m{special projects that need more personal attention}[0m . 
(25) In most cases , [1m[35m{the IRS}[0m says , [4m[33m{these projects}[0m are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses . 
(26) The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects , according to [34m{Marshall V. Washburn , deputy assistant commissioner for examination}[0m . 
(27) [33m{Auditors involved in noncriminal projects}[0m ca n't send anyone to jail , but [33m{they}[0m can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like . 
(28) The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes . 
(29) Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips , people who engage in large cash transactions , and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting [1m[33m{the capital gain}[0m in another home by the end of the same year ; [1m[33m{the gain}[0m must be rolled over within two years to defer tax . 
(30) And now that returns must show dependents ' [32m{Social Security}[0m numbers , [1m[35m{the IRS}[0m wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased . 
(31) Impetus for the direct - seller project came from [34m{a congressional hearing some years back}[0m . 
(32) [34m{It}[0m prompted [4m[31m{an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs}[0m , [34m{Mr. Washburn}[0m says . 
(33) [4m[31m{The study}[0m provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part - time business . 
(34) [31m{The Tax Court}[0m recently denied business deductions by [4m[34m{Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who both were part - time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields}[0m . 
(35) For 1984 , [4m[34m{they}[0m reported gross income of $ 1,647 from [1m[36m{Amway}[0m sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 . 
(36) [31m{The Tax Court}[0m did n't believe that [4m[34m{the Rubins , who earned $ 65,619 in their regular jobs ,}[0m treated the sideline as [1m[31m{a real business}[0m and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from [1m[31m{it}[0m . 
(37) [4m[36m{The Direct Selling Association , a trade group ,}[0m points out that [4m[36m{its}[0m members , which include [1m[36m{Amway Corp.}[0m , cooperate with [1m[35m{the IRS}[0m to distribute tax - compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public - service television program on the subject . 
(38) [4m[34m{The independent - contractor project , which began in 1988 ,}[0m involves [3m[31m{about 350 IRS agents}[0m . 
(39) In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 , reports Raymond P. Keenan , assistant commissioner for collection , [3m[31m{they}[0m examined about 13,000 employers , assessed more than $ 67 million in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self - employed contractors . 
(40) The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions , mostly paid by small firms . 
(41) Many workers , especially professionals , want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't . 
(42) But many others , who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation , become tipsters for [1m[35m{the IRS}[0m , says [4m[35m{Jerry Lackey , who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando}[0m . 
(43) Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't , [4m[35m{he}[0m says . 
(44) In [4m[35m{his}[0m area , [4m[35m{Mr. Lackey}[0m continues , the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction -- doing framing , drywall , masonry and similar work . 
(45) But a medical clinic with [3m[32m{about 20 employees}[0m wrongly listed all of [3m[32m{them}[0m -- including physicians and receptionists -- as independent contractors . 
(46) [1m[35m{The IRS}[0m assessed the clinic $ 350,000 in back payroll taxes . 
(47) [1m[35m{It}[0m assessed nearly $ 500,000 against a cruise - ship company that carried about 100 deckhands , cooks , bartenders , entertainers and other employees as self - employed independents . 
(48) Revenue - short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of [4m[36m{tax delinquents}[0m , and perhaps none tracks [4m[36m{them}[0m down with more relish than does [35m{New York}[0m since [35m{it}[0m acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 . 
(49) [35m{The state 's}[0m tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other [35m{New York}[0m agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with [1m[35m{the IRS}[0m , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages . 
(50) Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , [31m{they}[0m single out high - income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed [35m{New York}[0m income - tax returns . 
(51) [35m{The state}[0m has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of [35m{the state}[0m , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially [1m[32m{Florida , which has no personal income tax}[0m . 
(52) Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in [35m{the state}[0m , doctors , dentists , and accountants , says [4m[35m{Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax - department division that develops the computer - matching programs}[0m . 
(53) [4m[32m{The department}[0m has collected over $ 6.5 million from [4m[31m{brokers}[0m so far and recommended more than 30 of [4m[31m{them}[0m for criminal prosecution . 
(54) In the early stage of [36m{checking}[0m people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , [4m[32m{it}[0m squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a [1m[32m{Florida}[0m resident . 
(55) `` [4m[32m{We}[0m think [4m[32m{we}[0m can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through [36m{the nonresident project}[0m , '' [4m[35m{Mr. Hicks}[0m declares . 
(56) Mr. Schmedel is editor of The Wall Street Journal 's Tax Report column .
