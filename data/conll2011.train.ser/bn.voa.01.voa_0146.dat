(0) At [3m[35m{the United Nations}[0m , controversy has broken out over [4m[34m{a proposal to drastically tighten sanctions against the Taliban government in Afghanistan}[0m . 
(1) [3m[32m{VOA}[0m correspondent Breck Ardery has more on this from [3m[35m{the United Nations}[0m . 
(2) [4m[34m{A proposed UN Security Council resolution jointly sponsored by Russia and the United States}[0m would tighten economic sanctions against [1m[35m{the Taliban}[0m and ban all weapon shipments to [1m[35m{them}[0m . 
(3) [4m[34m{The proposal}[0m goes considerably beyond the existing sanctions , which ban [1m[35m{Taliban}[0m air flights and freeze international bank accounts held by [1m[35m{the Taliban}[0m . 
(4) Sponsors say [4m[34m{the resolution}[0m is specifically meant to pressure [1m[35m{the Taliban}[0m , to abandon [1m[35m{its}[0m support of terrorism , and to surrender [3m[31m{indicted terrorist Osama Bin Laden}[0m , but [1m[34m{Pakistan 's}[0m Ambassador to the [1m[36m{United Nations}[0m Shamsed Ahmed told reporters [4m[32m{his}[0m nation is strongly against [4m[34m{the resolution}[0m and [4m[34m{it}[0m is the wrong way to fight terrorism . 
(5) [1m[34m{We}[0m abhor [1m[33m{terrorism in all its forms and manifestations}[0m . 
(6) [1m[34m{We}[0m are with [4m[31m{the international community}[0m in combating [1m[33m{this menace}[0m all over the world . 
(7) As far as [3m[31m{this particular individual}[0m is concerned , this is a problem that needs to be resolved between [3m[36m{the United States}[0m and [1m[35m{the government in Afghanistan , which now is Taliban}[0m . 
(8) [4m[32m{Mr. Ahmad}[0m says that instead of sanctions , [4m[31m{the international community}[0m should engage in a dialogue with [1m[35m{the Taliban}[0m , but [4m[36m{Russia 's}[0m Ambassador Serge Lavroff says the [1m[35m{Taliban}[0m leadership does not inspire trust . 
(9) The problem is that [1m[35m{the Taliban}[0m never delivered on a single promise , be this to start the dialogue , be this to stop fighting , be this to treat women and girls properly , or any other demand from [4m[33m{the Security Council}[0m , in particular to stop the support for terrorism . 
(10) [3m[34m{An American official}[0m told reporters [3m[33m{the proposed new sanctions}[0m are not meant to harm [31m{the Afghan people}[0m . 
(11) [3m[34m{He}[0m points out that [4m[35m{humanitarian aid}[0m is specifically exempt from [3m[33m{the sanctions}[0m . 
(12) [3m[34m{He}[0m says , [3m[36m{the United States}[0m is currently the largest single donor of food and relief supplies to [31m{the Afghan people}[0m and that [4m[35m{the aid}[0m will continue . 
(13) [1m[32m{Breck Ardery}[0m , [3m[32m{VOA News}[0m , at [3m[35m{the United Nations}[0m .
