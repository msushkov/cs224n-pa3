(0) Like many Heartland states , [4m[35m{Iowa}[0m has had trouble keeping young people down on the farm or anywhere within [31m{state lines}[0m . 
(1) With population waning , [4m[35m{the state}[0m is looking beyond [4m[35m{its}[0m borders for newcomers . 
(2) As [4m[33m{ABC 's}[0m Jim Sciutto reports , [3m[36m{one little town}[0m may provide a big lesson . 
(3) On [34m{homecoming night}[0m [3m[36m{Postville}[0m feels like Hometown , [4m[31m{USA}[0m , but a look around [3m[36m{this town of 2,000}[0m shows [3m[36m{it}[0m 's become a miniature Ellis Island . 
(4) [3m[36m{This}[0m was an all - white , all - christian community that all the sudden was taken over -- not taken over , that 's a very bad choice of words , but [33m{invaded}[0m by , perhaps different groups . 
(5) [33m{It}[0m began when [4m[34m{a Hasidic Jewish family}[0m bought [1m[32m{one of the town 's two meat - packing plants}[0m 13 years ago . 
(6) First [4m[34m{they}[0m brought in other Hasidic Jews , then Mexicans , Palestinians , Ukrainians . 
(7) [1m[33m{The plant and another next door}[0m changed the face of [3m[36m{Postville}[0m . 
(8) I think [3m[36m{Postville}[0m might be catching up with the rest of [4m[31m{America}[0m . 
(9) If you look all over [4m[31m{America}[0m , if you did a study of any great city , you would see the same thing . 
(10) [1m[33m{The plants}[0m helped spur economic development in [3m[36m{a town that had long been stagnant}[0m . 
(11) Stores are expanding . 
(12) New apartments and houses are being built , and there are hundreds of new jobs , making unemployment almost nonexistent . 
(13) What else would you like ? 
(14) [3m[36m{Postville}[0m now has 22 different nationalities , but some residents have n't welcomed [32m{the newcomers}[0m . 
(15) [32m{They}[0m have no insurance on [32m{their}[0m cars . 
(16) [32m{They}[0m do n't stop at stop signs . 
(17) [32m{They}[0m do not put [32m{their}[0m children in a cash -- [32m{they}[0m 've never heard of a car seat . 
(18) You know we 've been here a long time and I think most people would [1m[31m{meet}[0m [32m{them}[0m halfway , but [1m[31m{that}[0m does n't seem to be what [32m{they}[0m want . 
(19) For [36m{those who prefer the old Postville}[0m , [4m[36m{Mayor John Hyman}[0m has a simple answer . 
(20) [4m[36m{I}[0m just tell [36m{them}[0m , [36m{you}[0m 've got to change . 
(21) [32m{They}[0m 're here to stay . 
(22) [32m{They}[0m 're not gon na leave , and [36m{you}[0m 're going to have to adapt to [32m{these people}[0m . 
(23) [4m[35m{Iowa 's}[0m governor is now looking to [3m[35m{follow}[0m [3m[36m{Postville 's}[0m example , relaxing immigration quotas . 
(24) [3m[35m{It}[0m 's a goal that seems possible when on [34m{homecoming night}[0m [4m[32m{the starting kicker}[0m is 14 - year - old Nikita Kargalskiy , who may be 5,000 miles from [4m[32m{his}[0m hometown in Russia . 
(25) [35m{Jim Sciutto}[0m , [4m[33m{ABC News}[0m , [3m[36m{Postville Iowa}[0m .
