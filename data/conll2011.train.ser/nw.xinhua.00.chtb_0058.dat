(2) At the same time , [35m{he}[0m hoped that [1m[35m{Taiwan}[0m authorities would follow [34m{the trends of historical development}[0m and take opportunities to make active responses and wise choices for the political negotiations between [1m[34m{both sides of the Taiwan Straits}[0m . 
(3) [35m{Qichen Qian}[0m made the above comments while [35m{he}[0m talked about international situations and [1m[31m{China 's}[0m foreign affairs of 1997 at an interview with a reporter from the People 's Daily . 
(4) [35m{Qichen Qian}[0m said that in the nearly half year since the return of [32m{Hong Kong}[0m everything was done in an orderly fashion by the special administrative region 's government , and that the guidelines of " one country , two systems " , " administration of [32m{Hong Kong}[0m by [32m{Hong Kong}[0m people " and " a high degree of autonomy " were implemented effectively . 
(5) [32m{The special administrative region of Hong Kong}[0m maintained a good phase of prosperity and stabilization . 
(6) [35m{Qichen Qian}[0m said that [33m{we}[0m were always fully confident of [32m{Hong Kong 's}[0m prospects . 
(7) [33m{The central government}[0m and the people of [1m[31m{the whole country}[0m always gave strong backing to [32m{the special region 's}[0m government and the compatriots of [32m{Hong Kong}[0m . 
(8) [33m{We}[0m believed that [32m{Hong Kong}[0m could continue to maintain [32m{its}[0m position as a free port and a center of international finance , trade and shipping , and to keep [32m{its}[0m long - term prosperity and stability . 
(9) [35m{Qichen Qian}[0m also made a comment on the fact that beginning this year , [1m[33m{the Taiwan authorities}[0m continued to practice the so - called " practical diplomacy " , advocated that [1m[35m{Taiwan}[0m was a so - called " independent sovereign state " , and actively set up obstacles in the negotiations between [1m[34m{both sides of the straits}[0m . 
(10) [35m{He}[0m said that accomplishing the complete unification of [1m[31m{the motherland}[0m was the common wish of all the Chinese people throughout [1m[31m{the country}[0m and abroad . 
(11) Since [32m{Hong Kong 's}[0m return to [1m[31m{the motherland}[0m , relations between [1m[34m{both sides of the straits}[0m has drawn greater attention . 
(12) But the development of the separatist trend on [1m[35m{Taiwan}[0m has greatly hindering the process of peaceful reunification . 
(13) [35m{Qichen Qian}[0m also pointed out that Chairman Zemin Jiang seriously appealed again at the 15th People 's Congress that , as the first step , [1m[34m{both sides of the Straits}[0m could negotiate on " formally concluding the hostile state between [1m[34m{both sides}[0m under the principle of one China " and come to an agreement ; and on this basis [1m[34m{we}[0m could take up obligations together , maintain the integrity of [1m[31m{China 's}[0m sovereignty and territory , and plan out the development of relations between [1m[34m{both sides}[0m . 
(14) [33m{We}[0m hope Taiwanese authorities conform to [34m{the historical development trends}[0m , and take opportunities to make active responses and wise choices for political negotiations between [1m[34m{both sides of the Straits}[0m .
