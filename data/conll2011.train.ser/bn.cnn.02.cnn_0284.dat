(8) During a brief phone call with [4m[33m{their}[0m son from [1m[32m{Kuwait}[0m on surngd the Army asked [4m[33m{the Young family}[0m not to get into any specific details about what happened during [4m[33m{their}[0m son 's capture and release . 
(9) However , [4m[33m{the family}[0m did get in a company of questions about how [36m{he}[0m was treated . 
(10) [4m[33m{They}[0m learned [36m{he}[0m lost 20 pounds and also [4m[33m{their}[0m son told [4m[33m{them}[0m that in the last few days of [36m{his}[0m capture , [3m[36m{things}[0m were n't so bad but that [3m[36m{they}[0m were very rough in the beginning . 
(11) Now [4m[33m{they}[0m are learning more details that [4m[33m{their}[0m son in fact was kicked and beaten after [36m{his}[0m capture , and that [36m{his}[0m fellow pilot David Williams had [4m[36m{a knife}[0m held to [4m[31m{his}[0m throat immediately after an tur , according to an interview [4m[33m{their}[0m son was allowed to conduct with `` The Washington Post '' , who flew with [36m{him}[0m into [1m[32m{Kuwait}[0m . 
(12) [4m[33m{Their}[0m son is said to be in very good spirits now and back here in [35m{Georgia}[0m , after [1m[31m{three weeks of not knowing exactly what had happened to him}[0m , finally , for the very first time in [1m[31m{three weeks}[0m , [4m[33m{the Young family members}[0m got some sleep [3m[34m{last night}[0m for the first time in a long time . 
(13) Well , at least some family members did . 
(14) [1m[33m{She}[0m slept pretty good . 
(15) [34m{I}[0m 'm not kidding . 
(16) All right . 
(17) [34m{I}[0m came home . 
(18) [1m[33m{She}[0m was in bed . 
(19) [34m{I}[0m laid on [3m[33m{the couch}[0m for a couple of hours , walked around . 
(20) [34m{I}[0m thought , [34m{I}[0m 'm going to sleep [3m[34m{tonight}[0m , [34m{I}[0m really am . 
(21) [34m{I}[0m got in there , laid down . 
(22) [1m[33m{She}[0m must have took a pill or something . 
(23) Sounded like a saw mill going on next to [34m{me}[0m . 
(24) Back on [3m[33m{the couch}[0m again . 
(25) Hey , [1m[33m{I}[0m was tired , and besides , it was relief , you know ? 
(26) [1m[33m{I}[0m could finally sleep and know everything was okay . 
(27) Reporter : 
(28) Of course , pictures and videotape and a phone call is one thing , but [4m[36m{seeing}[0m [4m[33m{their}[0m son in person is quite another , and [4m[33m{they}[0m are , of course , hoping [4m[36m{that}[0m will happen very soon . 
(29) [36m{Young 's}[0m mother says , when [1m[33m{she}[0m sees [1m[33m{her}[0m son , [1m[33m{she}[0m plans on hugging [36m{him}[0m for a good solid half hour . 
(30) Back to [3m[32m{you}[0m , [3m[32m{Judy}[0m . 
(31) At least , we would think , if that 's the case . 
(32) Thanks very much . 
(33) Let 's turn to [4m[32m{Jamie at Ft. Hood , Texas , where she 's been talking with the family of Chief Warrant Officer David Williams}[0m . 
(34) For [32m{them}[0m , [4m[32m{Jamie}[0m , given what we just heard about [4m[36m{the knife at his throat}[0m , [32m{they}[0m must be incredibly relieved .

(36) [3m[32m{You}[0m know , [3m[32m{Judy}[0m , [32m{they}[0m have been learning more and more as [35m{the day}[0m goes on . 
(37) The focus is clearly not on [33m{their}[0m treatment or [33m{their}[0m capture but [33m{their}[0m freedom . 
(38) [4m[32m{I}[0m was on the phone with [1m[36m{Michelle Williams}[0m [32m{yesterday , when she saw those first pictures on CNN of her husband}[0m , and [1m[36m{she}[0m shrieked with delight . 
(39) For [31m{three weeks}[0m [1m[36m{she}[0m 's watched and waited for some news . 
(40) The only other pictures was [4m[31m{his}[0m abandoned helicopter . 
(41) [1m[36m{She}[0m knew instantly when [1m[36m{she}[0m saw [36m{it}[0m , because of the 1st Cavalry emblem and special markings [36m{it}[0m was [4m[31m{his}[0m . 
(42) [31m{It}[0m 's been a long three weeks . 
(43) [35m{Today}[0m is date [1m[36m{she}[0m was waiting for . 
(44) [4m[32m{I}[0m had a chance to spend some time with [1m[36m{her}[0m [32m{yesterday}[0m . 
(45) This morning on `` American Morning '' [1m[36m{she}[0m told us about what [1m[36m{her}[0m reaction was when [1m[36m{she}[0m saw [4m[35m{those first pictures of her husband free}[0m . 
(46) [1m[36m{I}[0m was so happy . 
(47) [1m[36m{I}[0m knew [1m[36m{I}[0m never lost hope that [4m[31m{he}[0m was alive and just seeing [4m[31m{him}[0m and being able to see [4m[31m{his}[0m eyes and [4m[31m{his}[0m reaction to [4m[31m{his}[0m rescue just took a huge load off [1m[36m{my}[0m shoulders . 
(48) Reporter :
