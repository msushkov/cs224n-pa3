(0) [34m{This}[0m is The World . 
(1) I am Lisa Mullins . 
(2) [31m{The United States}[0m is the heavyweight champion of [35m{the world}[0m when it comes to [4m[31m{the internet}[0m . 
(3) Now based on past experience , [36m{you}[0m 'd think [3m[36m{the main challenger for the crown}[0m would be Japan . 
(4) Well , [36m{you}[0m would be wrong . 
(5) When it comes to [4m[31m{the internet}[0m , [3m[36m{Japan}[0m could have been a contender . 
(6) This week in [4m[36m{Tokyo}[0m , a blue ribbon advisory panel wrapped up proposals aimed at turning [3m[36m{Japan}[0m into an information technology powerhouse by 2005 . 
(7) We asked [34m{The World 's}[0m Lucy Craft to find out how fast [4m[32m{the Japanese}[0m will have to drive to catch up to the Americans on [4m[31m{the information superhighway}[0m . 
(8) By all appearances , [3m[36m{Japan}[0m would seem a natural candidate to be the next [4m[31m{internet}[0m superpower . 
(9) At this recent technology trade show in [4m[36m{Tokyo}[0m , for example , [4m[33m{NTT Docomell , Japan 's biggest cell phone maker}[0m touted [4m[33m{its}[0m latest model . 
(10) By next year [32m{callers}[0m will be able to see as well as hear [32m{each other}[0m , thanks to the addition of a tiny video monitor . 
(11) [3m[36m{The country that gave the world VCRs , the Walkman and video games}[0m continues to churn out entertainment related devices . 
(12) One of this Christmas season 's hottest items is this . 
(13) A consumer version of a DJ 's night club turntable , complete with simulated scraps , sounds and effects buttons . 
(14) Whether it is cell phones , digital cameras or flat TV screens , [3m[36m{Japan}[0m continues to dominate many sectors of technology and [3m[36m{its}[0m manufacturing expertise is still world - class , and yet , it 's something of a paradox but after a decade of explosive [4m[31m{internet}[0m growth around [35m{the world}[0m , only one in five [4m[32m{Japanese}[0m goes on line . 
(15) It is very difficult to rationally explain why because visibly it does n't make sense . 
(16) [1m[34m{Lee Daniels}[0m is President of [3m[32m{Jupiter Telecommunications , Japan 's largest cable operator}[0m . 
(17) You would think that [33m{companies}[0m are so knowledgeable , so educated , so technically literate that [33m{they}[0m would be at the forefront of the development . 
(18) [4m[31m{Internet}[0m access fees here run as much as 10 times as high as in the West , thanks to a near monopoly held by [4m[33m{NTT , the politically powerful former state owned telephone company}[0m . 
(19) Though [3m[34m{its sky high rates}[0m are why [4m[32m{Japanese}[0m do n't go on line as much as citizens elsewhere , but [3m[32m{Jupiter}[0m chief Daniels says it all comes down to [1m[35m{conservative , conformist , consensus lobbying Japanese society itself that 's impeding growth of the internet here}[0m . 
(20) [1m[34m{I}[0m think it really reverts back in to these traditional values , the way [4m[32m{Japanese}[0m are educated and basically individualism is not encouraged in neither school setting or corporate setting , and the people who are really making a difference in [31m{the United States}[0m are [1m[32m{individuals who are entrepreneurs}[0m . 
(21) [1m[32m{They}[0m will come up with an idea , [3m[33m{take}[0m the risk and lead . 
(22) [1m[32m{They}[0m are not afraid to go against normal traditional ways of doing things and [3m[33m{taking}[0m personal risk , and in [3m[36m{Japan}[0m you do n't see [3m[33m{that risk factor}[0m as evident as what you would find in [31m{the United States}[0m . 
(23) Which partly explains why [4m[35m{Japanese political leaders such as Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori}[0m are in a fix . 
(24) Well , desperate to escape the economic stagnation that has mired [3m[36m{this country}[0m for over a decade , [4m[35m{they}[0m also worry that traditional ways of life would be swept aside by [4m[31m{the internet}[0m with dotcom jobs replacing life - long employment security , e-commerce endangering business built on personal relationships . 
(25) [4m[35m{They}[0m hate to see some of the traditional values that [3m[36m{Japan}[0m has always distinguished [3m[36m{itself}[0m , starting to erode . 
(26) Again , [1m[34m{Lee Daniels}[0m . 
(27) And there is [3m[31m{a conflict that exists}[0m . 
(28) As you start moving down [3m[35m{this path towards technical innovation}[0m , [3m[35m{it}[0m invites disruption or [3m[35m{it}[0m brings about [3m[31m{the conflict}[0m much quicker than [1m[34m{I}[0m think most people would be prepared to start dealing with [3m[31m{it}[0m . 
(29) [1m[34m{I}[0m think there is a lot of issues that [3m[36m{Japan}[0m is starting to question , how do [4m[32m{they}[0m adapt , how do [4m[32m{they}[0m [4m[34m{change}[0m , how do [4m[32m{they}[0m preserve what is good about [4m[32m{their}[0m society while making [4m[34m{these changes}[0m to be more competitive with what 's happening throughout the rest of [35m{the world}[0m . 
(30) In a crisis , such as right after World War II , [3m[36m{Japan}[0m has proven adept at rapid change , but in the past drastic reform has always been masterminded from above by Japanese bureaucrats . 
(31) A true [4m[31m{internet}[0m connected society and economy wo n't emerge , say experts , without [1m[36m{a grassroots led revolution}[0m , and [1m[36m{that}[0m would be a first with [3m[36m{this 2000 - year - old country}[0m . 
(32) For [34m{The World}[0m , [1m[33m{I}[0m am Lucy Craft in [4m[36m{Tokyo}[0m .
