(0) [3m[35m{Local elections}[0m took place peacefully across [4m[31m{Colombia}[0m on Sunday despite violence that had marred the run - up to [3m[35m{the elections}[0m . 
(1) Colombians voted for [3m[34m{candidates for governors , mayors and town council members}[0m , many of [3m[34m{them}[0m independents challenging [1m[34m{the two traditional political parties}[0m . 
(2) [3m[33m{Vordis Navaro}[0m reports from [3m[31m{the capital Bogota}[0m . 
(3) [3m[35m{The voting}[0m comes after several weeks of increased tensions with 21 candidates killed and more than 100 withdrawing from [3m[35m{the elections}[0m citing intimidation . 
(4) During the past week alone , both rebel and paramilitary groups kidnapped eight political officials or candidates . 
(5) The two to influence the democratic process . 
(6) [4m[31m{The government}[0m launched a massive security operation to counter the violence . 
(7) Some 150,000 soldiers and police were deployed across [4m[31m{the country}[0m to stop any possible disruptions .

(12) [3m[32m{The Colombian rebels}[0m considered [1m[35m{the political system}[0m illegitimate but [3m[36m{the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or Farc}[0m allowed [3m[35m{the elections}[0m to proceed nevertheless . 
(13) However , charges that [3m[32m{the leftist rebels}[0m stole ballots caused election officials to void voting in one of the five [3m[36m{Farc}[0m - controlled areas and the mayoral candidate openly backed by [3m[36m{the Farc}[0m in the rebel stronghold of lost to an independent candidate . 
(14) [3m[35m{The nationwide local elections}[0m are a test for [1m[34m{Colombians ' two traditional parties the Liberals and the Conservatives}[0m . 
(15) [1m[34m{They}[0m are increasingly blamed for [4m[31m{Colombia 's}[0m woes and many of the candidates who won in major areas are independent of [1m[34m{those political parties}[0m . 
(16) But beyond the thousands of seats up for grabs , leaders say [4m[31m{the Colombia 's}[0m embattled democratic system is at stake . 
(17) [4m[31m{Colombia}[0m has one of Latin America 's strongest electoral traditions and little history of military coups but fighting between rival paramilitary groups , government troops and rebel groups has left thousands dead and forced [1m[36m{millions}[0m to flee [1m[36m{their}[0m homes . 
(18) [3m[33m{Vordis Navaro for VOA News , Bogota .}[0m
