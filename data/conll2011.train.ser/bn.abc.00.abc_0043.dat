(0) [35m{Israeli Prime Minister Barak}[0m [36m{says}[0m [35m{he}[0m will [4m[35m{resign}[0m tomorrow . 
(1) Sometimes [31m{things}[0m are not as [31m{they}[0m seem . 
(2) [36m{This}[0m is one of [31m{them}[0m . 
(3) [36m{This}[0m is a political chess move . 
(4) [4m[36m{ABC 's Gillian Findlay}[0m is in [34m{Israel}[0m tonight . 
(5) [36m{It}[0m was an emotional speech and one that Israelis had not expected . 
(6) `` Tomorrow morning [35m{I}[0m will inform the President of [35m{my}[0m decision to [4m[35m{resign}[0m , '' said [35m{Mr. Barak}[0m . 
(7) `` [35m{I}[0m will ask again for [32m{the trust of the Israeli people}[0m . '' 
(8) [32m{That trust}[0m has plummeted in the year and a half since [35m{Barak}[0m came to power . 
(9) Failed peace talks with the Palestinians and the violence that has followed weakened [35m{him}[0m , strengthened the speculation that [33m{former Prime Minister Netanyahu}[0m might return to politics and try to unseat [35m{him}[0m . 
(10) [33m{Mr. Netanyahu}[0m would win easily according to polls . 
(11) That may be why [35m{Barak}[0m has [4m[34m{chosen}[0m to [4m[35m{resign}[0m now . 
(12) [34m{Israel}[0m was headed towards an early general election . 
(13) By [36m{announcing}[0m [35m{his}[0m resignation , [35m{Barak}[0m has ensured it will be a different election , a special election for Prime Minister only . 
(14) [33m{Mr. Netanyahu}[0m will not be eligible . 
(15) That 's because under [34m{Israel 's}[0m election rules , only a sitting member of parliament can run in a special election . 
(16) [33m{Mr. Netanyahu}[0m gave up [33m{his}[0m seat when [33m{he}[0m lost the last election . 
(17) Thanks , [4m[36m{Gillian Findlay}[0m in [34m{Israel}[0m .
