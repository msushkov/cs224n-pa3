(19) [1m[35m{The east Asian countries}[0m are not entirely without conflicts and disputes . 
(20) But in order to safeguard fundamental benefits to the people of [1m[35m{all east Asian countries}[0m , and to promote the lofty cause of peace and development for mankind , we must progressively strengthen the east Asian cooperation . 
(21) [1m[34m{Chairman Zemin Jiang}[0m solemnly elaborated on [3m[34m{China 's}[0m stand at [4m[35m{this meeting}[0m . 
(22) [1m[34m{He}[0m emphatically pointed out that " We should uphold the principles of mutual respect , equal participation , mutual benefit , and co-development ; we should strengthen cooperation in economy and technology , especially in the field of new high level technology , and establish reasonable regional economic structures , and form a mode of economic cooperation on the basis of learning from others ' strengths and offsetting others ' weaknesses , and mutual benefiting from advantages , balancing interests , and practicing non-exclusiveness and non-discrimination ; and we should strengthen trust , broaden common understanding , seek common points while maintaining differences , and resolve disputes appropriately through friendly dialogue and consultation to guarantee [34m{the region 's}[0m peace and stability . " 
(23) Everything is difficult at the very beginning .
