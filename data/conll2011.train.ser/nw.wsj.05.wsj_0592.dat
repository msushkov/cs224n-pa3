(0) [4m[31m{Margaret Thatcher 's}[0m instinctive response to [35m{the latest upheaval in her government}[0m is to promise [4m[35m{business as usual}[0m . 
(1) [4m[35m{That}[0m may be the last thing [4m[31m{she}[0m needs . 
(2) As the air clears from [1m[36m{last week 's}[0m storm of resignations and reshufflings , [33m{the government}[0m faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in [33m{its}[0m policies . 
(3) [4m[31m{The prime minister}[0m and [4m[31m{her}[0m new chancellor of the exchequer , the untested John Major , need to haul [3m[35m{the country}[0m through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set [3m[31m{the economy}[0m moving again . 
(4) [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m has to come to terms with European economic integration , beginning with [3m[34m{the European Monetary System}[0m , which [3m[35m{Britain}[0m is committed to [4m[34m{joining}[0m fully someday . 
(5) Finally , [33m{the government}[0m has to convince [1m[31m{a rattled financial community -- and voters}[0m -- [33m{it}[0m is proceeding coherently toward [33m{its}[0m goals . 
(6) It sounds like the work of a decade , but the deadline is late 1991 , when [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m is expected to call another national election . 
(7) What 's worrying [4m[31m{her}[0m supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable . 
(8) [4m[31m{She}[0m could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation , high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit . 
(9) Though [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m has pulled through other crises , [34m{supporters}[0m wonder if [4m[31m{her}[0m steely , autocratic ways are the right formula today . 
(10) `` There 's a rising fear that perhaps [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher 's}[0m style of management has become a political liability , '' says Bill Martin , senior economist at London brokers UBS - Phillips & Drew . 
(11) [4m[31m{The prime minister 's}[0m insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers -- including [36m{an economic guru who openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson}[0m -- [3m[36m{confused}[0m [1m[31m{the financial community}[0m . 
(12) [1m[36m{Last week}[0m , the strategy of playing [1m[32m{the two experts}[0m off [1m[32m{each other}[0m blew up : [4m[33m{Mr. Lawson}[0m quit in exasperation and [36m{Sir Alan Walters , the adviser}[0m , announced [36m{his}[0m resignation within an hour . 
(13) [3m[36m{The confusion}[0m could be costly . 
(14) Currency traders , suspecting [1m[33m{Mr. Major}[0m wo n't defend [3m[32m{the pound}[0m strenuously , sent [3m[32m{the British currency}[0m sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark . 
(15) Analysts expect further jitters this week . 
(16) A continuing slide in [3m[32m{the pound}[0m could force [33m{the government}[0m to push through [1m[34m{another rise in the base rate , currently 15 %}[0m . 
(17) [1m[34m{That}[0m could shove a weak economy into recession . 
(18) [4m[32m{Economists}[0m have been anticipating [3m[33m{a slump}[0m for months , but [4m[32m{they}[0m now say [3m[33m{it}[0m will be deeper and longer than [4m[32m{they}[0m had thought . 
(19) [3m[35m{Britain 's}[0m economy `` is developing rapidly toward no - growth , '' says J. Paul Horne , international economist with Smith Barney , Harris Upham Co. in Paris . 
(20) [31m{A mild slowdown}[0m probably would have run [31m{its}[0m course by early 1991 , economists say , while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into 1992 . 
(21) Recovery could be hampered if [3m[35m{Britain 's}[0m major trading partners in Europe , which are enjoying robust economic activity , cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991 . 
(22) That would leave [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m little room for maneuver . 
(23) For [32m{the Tories}[0m to win the next election , voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand . 
(24) Though [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m does n't need to call an election until June 1992 , [4m[31m{she}[0m would prefer doing so in late 1991 . 
(25) `` If [3m[31m{the economy}[0m shows no sign of turning around in about year 's time , [4m[31m{she}[0m will be very vulnerable , '' says John Barnes , a lecturer at the London School of Economics . 
(26) There 's an equally pressing deadline for [33m{the government}[0m to define [33m{its}[0m monetary and economic ties to the rest of the European Community . 
(27) [33m{It}[0m has sent mixed signals about [33m{its}[0m willingness to take part in the exchange - rate mechanism of [3m[34m{the European Monetary System}[0m , which links the major EC currencies . 
(28) At a June EC summit , [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m appeared to ease [4m[31m{her}[0m opposition to full EMS membership , saying [3m[35m{Britain}[0m would join once [3m[35m{its}[0m inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized capital movements . 
(29) Since then , [33m{the government}[0m has left observers wondering if [33m{it}[0m ever meant to join . 
(30) [4m[36m{Sir Alan}[0m assailed the monetary arrangement as `` half - baked '' in an article being published in an American economics journal . 
(31) That produced little reaction from [4m[36m{his}[0m boss , reinforcing speculation [33m{the government}[0m would use [33m{its}[0m two conditions as a pretext for avoiding [4m[34m{full EMS membership}[0m . 
(32) Despite the departure of [4m[33m{Mr. Lawson}[0m and [1m[33m{Sir Alan}[0m , the tug - of - war over [3m[34m{the EMS}[0m could continue . 
(33) Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a [4m[33m{Lawson}[0m ally on [3m[34m{the EMS}[0m , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership . 
(34) Of immediate concern is whether [33m{the Thatcher government}[0m will continue [4m[33m{Mr. Lawson 's}[0m policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt authorities move interest rates . 
(35) [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m `` does n't like taking orders from foreigners , '' says Tim Congdon , economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC . 
(36) As Conservatives rally around [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m during [35m{the crisis}[0m , many harbor hopes [1m[36m{last week 's}[0m debacle will prompt change . 
(37) `` We wo n't have any more of [35m{this wayward behavior}[0m , '' says Sir Peter Hordern , a backbench [32m{Tory}[0m member of Parliament . 
(38) `` [32m{The party}[0m is fed up with sackings of good people . '' 
(39) It 's an unrealistic expectation . 
(40) As long as a decade ago , [4m[31m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m declared [4m[31m{she}[0m did n't want debate in [4m[31m{her}[0m cabinet ; [4m[31m{she}[0m wanted strong government . 
(41) Over the weekend , [4m[31m{she}[0m said [4m[31m{she}[0m did n't intend to change [4m[31m{her}[0m style and denied [4m[31m{she}[0m is authoritarian . 
(42) `` Nonsense , '' [4m[31m{she}[0m told an interviewer yesterday on London Weekend Television . 
(43) `` [4m[31m{I}[0m am staying [4m[31m{my own sweet , reasonable self}[0m .
