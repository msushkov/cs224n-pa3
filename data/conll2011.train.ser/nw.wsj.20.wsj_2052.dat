(0) When [36m{the Soviets}[0m announced [36m{their}[0m last soldier had left [4m[36m{Afghanistan}[0m in [1m[31m{February}[0m , the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria . 
(1) [4m[36m{It}[0m was `` [36m{the Soviets '}[0m Vietnam . '' 
(2) [1m[33m{The Kabul regime}[0m would fall . 
(3) [35m{Millions of refugees}[0m would rush home . 
(4) A resistance government would walk into [3m[33m{Kabul}[0m . 
(5) Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered . 
(6) Eight months after [3m[31m{Gen. Boris Gromov}[0m walked across the bridge into [36m{the U.S.S.R.}[0m , [1m[33m{a Soviet - controlled regime}[0m remains in [3m[33m{Kabul}[0m , [35m{the refugees}[0m sit in [35m{their}[0m camps , and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever . 
(7) But there never was a chance that [4m[34m{the Afghan resistance}[0m would overthrow [1m[33m{the Kabul regime}[0m quickly and easily . 
(8) [1m[35m{Soviet leaders}[0m said [1m[35m{they}[0m would support [1m[35m{their}[0m [4m[35m{Kabul}[0m clients by all means necessary -- and did . 
(9) [1m[36m{The U.S.}[0m said [1m[36m{it}[0m would fully support [4m[34m{the resistance}[0m -- and did n't . 
(10) With [32m{the February 1987 U.N. accords}[0m `` relating to [4m[36m{Afghanistan}[0m , '' [4m[33m{the Soviet Union}[0m got everything [4m[33m{it}[0m needed to consolidate permanent control . 
(11) The terms of [32m{the Geneva accords}[0m leave [4m[33m{Moscow}[0m free to provide [4m[33m{its}[0m clients in [3m[33m{Kabul}[0m with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring [1m[36m{the U.S.}[0m and [1m[34m{Pakistan}[0m to cut off aid . 
(12) The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last - minute addition of a unilateral American caveat , that U.S. aid to [4m[34m{the resistance}[0m would continue as long as Soviet aid to [4m[35m{Kabul}[0m did . 
(13) But as soon as [32m{the accords}[0m were signed , American officials sharply reduced [4m[31m{aid}[0m . 
(14) In February 1989 , when [36m{the Soviets}[0m said [36m{they}[0m had completed [36m{their}[0m pullout , [1m[36m{the U.S.}[0m cut [4m[31m{it}[0m further . 
(15) Not so [36m{the Soviets}[0m . 
(16) [3m[31m{Gen. Gromov himself}[0m said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $ 1 billion of military equipment and installations for [1m[33m{the Kabul regime}[0m . 
(17) Since [3m[35m{the troop withdrawal}[0m , [4m[33m{Moscow}[0m has poured in [34m{an additional $ 200 to $ 300 million worth per month -- nearly $ 2 billion since February , equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years}[0m . 
(18) [34m{This}[0m includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called `` new peaceful long - range weapons , '' including more than 800 SCUD missiles . 
(19) By early [1m[34m{May}[0m , [4m[33m{Moscow}[0m had delivered , for example , 1,000 trucks , about 100 tanks , artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles . 
(20) Later that [1m[34m{month}[0m , [4m[33m{it}[0m added an entire tank brigade , including 120 T - 72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state - of - the - art infantry fighting vehicles . 
(21) By September , a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles , 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet - trained Afghan troops had arrived in [3m[34m{Kandahar}[0m . 
(22) In the last few weeks , [4m[33m{Moscow}[0m has added [33m{FROG - 7B missiles , the bomber version of the An - 12 , MiG - 23BN high - altitude aircraft , MiG - 29s , which can outfly Pakistan 's U.S. - built F16s , and Sukhoi SU - 27 fighter - bombers , which can outfly the MiG - 29s}[0m . 
(23) [4m[33m{Moscow}[0m claims [33m{this}[0m is all needed to protect [1m[33m{the Kabul regime}[0m against [4m[34m{the guerrilla resistance}[0m . 
(24) It is well - known that the regular Afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts . 
(25) But [3m[36m{this}[0m is not the entire Afghan army , and [3m[36m{it}[0m is no longer [4m[35m{Kabul 's}[0m only military force . 
(26) Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in [36m{the U.S.S.R.}[0m and other East bloc nations ; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned . 
(27) In addition , [1m[33m{the regime}[0m has established well - paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000 , including 35,000 Soviet - trained troops of the Interior Ministry -LRB- KHAD / WAD -RRB- , which still is directed by 1,500 Soviet KGB officers . 
(28) Even if [1m[36m{not all these forces}[0m are committed to [1m[33m{the regime}[0m , [1m[36m{they}[0m are now dependent on [1m[33m{it}[0m . 
(29) And [1m[35m{thousands of Afghan children}[0m have been taken to [36m{the Soviet Union , where they are hostage for the behavior of their families}[0m . 
(30) Since 1981 , Indian military advisers have been assisting [1m[33m{the Kabul regime}[0m . 
(31) In preparation for [3m[35m{the withdrawal}[0m , [4m[33m{Moscow}[0m , [4m[35m{Kabul}[0m and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel . 
(32) Cuban military personnel also have been active in [4m[36m{Afghanistan}[0m since 1979 . 
(33) [36m{The Soviets}[0m cut [35m{a deal with Iran : a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy}[0m . 
(34) [35m{The deal}[0m was symbolized by the restoration of the Shi'ite Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry . 
(35) Moreover , serious questions have been raised about [3m[35m{the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces}[0m . 
(36) Before [3m[32m{his}[0m assassination in 1988 , [3m[32m{President Zia of Pakistan}[0m repeatedly stated that [1m[32m{fresh Soviet troops}[0m were being inserted into [4m[36m{Afghanistan}[0m even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn . 
(37) Rep. Bill McCollum -LRB- R. , Fla. -RRB- reports that [1m[32m{these}[0m included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards , ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms . 
(38) Meanwhile , [1m[33m{the Kabul regime}[0m is increasingly successful at portraying [4m[34m{the resistance}[0m as bloody - minded fanatics . 
(39) In this [1m[33m{they}[0m are aided by years of American , European , Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public . 
(40) This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better , moderate leaders . 
(41) In autumn last year , for example , the regime garrison at [3m[34m{Kandahar}[0m was prepared to [34m{surrender}[0m [3m[34m{the city}[0m to resistance moderates . 
(42) At the last minute , however , Pakistani officials sent in [4m[32m{Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar , perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists ,}[0m with a demand that [34m{the surrender}[0m be made to [4m[32m{his}[0m forces . 
(43) The deal fell through , and [3m[34m{Kandahar}[0m remains a major regime base . 
(44) [4m[34m{The resistance}[0m lacks not only air power , armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves . 
(45) [31m{Experienced resistance commanders}[0m wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down [1m[33m{the regime}[0m . 
(46) Instead , [31m{they}[0m were pressured by [1m[34m{Pakistan 's}[0m ISI , the channel for [31m{their}[0m support , into attacking Jalalabad . 
(47) [31m{They}[0m took more than 25 % casualties ; journalists report that [31m{they}[0m faced minefields without mine detectors . 
(48) The wonder is not that [4m[34m{the resistance}[0m has failed to topple [1m[33m{the Kabul regime}[0m , but that [4m[34m{it}[0m continues to exist and fight at all . 
(49) Last summer , in response to congressional criticism , [1m[31m{the State Department and the CIA}[0m said [1m[31m{they}[0m had resumed [1m[33m{military aid to the resistance}[0m months after [1m[33m{it}[0m was cut off ; but it is not clear how much is being sent or when [1m[33m{it}[0m will arrive . 
(50) For months [4m[34m{the resistance}[0m has been defenseless against air attack . 
(51) Thus far there is no indication that [4m[34m{they}[0m have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons . 
(52) Indeed , U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success [4m[34m{the weakened resistance}[0m achieves by the end of this year . 
(53) Moscow and [4m[35m{Kabul}[0m must have found that information useful . 
(54) For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent , based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf . 
(55) No settlement negotiated by others can force [1m[32m{the Afghan people}[0m to give up [1m[32m{their}[0m struggle . 
(56) A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon [1m[32m{them}[0m to die in vain . 
(57) Creation of a new , realistic U.S. policy is long overdue . 
(58) Ms. Klass , editor and co-author of `` Afghanistan : The Great Game Revisited '' -LRB- Freedom House -RRB- , directs the Freedom House program on Afghanistan / Southwest Asia .
