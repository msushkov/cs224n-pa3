(0) And so [1m[34m{the Supreme Court}[0m [1m[35m{is}[0m about to decide [1m[31m{a case that will probably determine who becomes the next President}[0m . 
(1) If [1m[35m{this}[0m strikes you as an extraordinary turn of events , well [1m[35m{it}[0m strikes many overseas as nearly unbelievable . 
(2) In the democracies of [3m[31m{Europe}[0m , legal experts are saying [1m[35m{it}[0m ca n't happen here . 
(3) [4m[34m{Philippe Shatiney}[0m is an editor of [1m[32m{the French news weekly , Mahiyan}[0m . 
(4) [4m[34m{Philippe}[0m , could [1m[35m{it}[0m happen anywhere else . 
(5) Oh , [4m[34m{I}[0m really think not . 
(6) First of all , because there are so few countries which are organized on the American model with , the powers of the state . 
(7) So yes [4m[34m{I}[0m think there is a lot of bemusement here in [3m[31m{Europe}[0m about the difficulties that the Americans are having in choosing a President . 
(8) [4m[34m{I}[0m think there is also a lot of amusement though , there is a lot of finger pointing . 
(9) It 's always funny for the small guys to laugh when [36m{the giant}[0m trips over [36m{his}[0m feet . 
(10) Well , let 's look at [1m[34m{the United States Supreme Court itself}[0m and [4m[35m{our}[0m justice system , now is there an institution that is independent of politics that serves anything like the function that [1m[34m{the US Supreme Court}[0m serves ? 
(11) Well , yes mostly European judicial systems do have a form of the Supreme Court . 
(12) However , for example , in [4m[31m{France}[0m the strict machinery of justice is separated from the constitutional court , which is a separate body , but yes there also [4m[36m{the members}[0m are appointed by the President and therefore there also , [4m[36m{the members of the Coseque Constitutionalle}[0m are somewhat open to criticism that [4m[33m{the decisions}[0m are often more motivated by politics than [4m[33m{they}[0m are by the law . 
(13) However , [4m[34m{I}[0m think that the image that [1m[36m{we Europeans}[0m had , of [3m[36m{the American system}[0m and especially of [1m[34m{the US Supreme Court}[0m , was that those justices were above politics and , [4m[34m{I}[0m think , that is also one of the bad surprises that [3m[32m{this election}[0m is reserving to [1m[36m{us Europeans}[0m is that finally [4m[35m{your}[0m system is not as perfect as [1m[36m{we}[0m were led to believe . 
(14) [35m{I}[0m wonder in terms of [1m[31m{this particular case , now this is certainly an extreme case in the United States with an unfathomably close election}[0m , How have other democracies dealt with effective ties , [35m{I}[0m mean could there for instance be one of elections , you know where [4m[35m{our}[0m type has gone to the courts , What happens to yours ? 
(15) Well , there have been cases in most recent elections in [4m[31m{France}[0m where [32m{the Coseque Constitutionalle}[0m having been apprised of doubtful procedures or doubtful ways of counting the votes , have decided either to [34m{the election}[0m and have [34m{it}[0m done over again or to in fact change the winner . 
(16) However , [4m[31m{our}[0m electoral system is so much more simple in the sense that [4m[31m{we}[0m have separate elections for the Presidency , for Parliament , for [4m[31m{our}[0m mayors and therefore usually most French voters are faced with the difficulty of choosing [4m[32m{a little paper ballotenne with a name on it}[0m and putting [4m[32m{that}[0m in [1m[33m{an envelop}[0m and then put [1m[33m{that}[0m in the urn , so there is a much less chance of error , at least , in [4m[31m{our}[0m French system . 
(17) Hey , it is interesting there also , when we look at [31m{the idea of checks and balances in a non-partisan judiciary}[0m , in terms of the checks and balances , [31m{that}[0m actually originated in [4m[31m{France}[0m . 
(18) Yes indeed , [31m{it}[0m was a political idea put forward in the writings of the and [33m{another very famous french political observer Alexis de Tocqueville who visited America and wrote an amazingly good book about American democracy}[0m , said exactly that , that [4m[35m{America}[0m seemed to [33m{him}[0m to be the single country in the world who has managed to apply the separation of powers between the judiciary , the executive , and the legislative in a better way than any other country . 
(19) So it 's quite surprising for [1m[36m{us Europeans}[0m to see that [1m[34m{the Supreme Court}[0m would be involved , not really it seems to [1m[36m{us}[0m in interpreting the law of the land or the constitution of [4m[35m{the United States}[0m , but more in deciding the merits of a terribly political case . 
(20) [4m[34m{Philippe Shatiney , an editor of the French news weekly ' Mahiyan ' .}[0m 
(21) Nice to speak with [4m[34m{you}[0m [4m[34m{Philippe}[0m . 
(22) Thank [35m{you}[0m .
