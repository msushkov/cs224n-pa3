(0) [32m{Yet another political scandal}[0m is racking [1m[34m{Japan}[0m . 
(1) But [4m[31m{this time}[0m [32m{it}[0m 's hurting opposition as well as ruling - party members . 
(2) And as [32m{it}[0m unfolds , [32m{it}[0m 's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of [4m[36m{Japanese society}[0m . 
(3) Already , ruling [1m[33m{Liberal Democratic Party}[0m demands that opposition members testify under oath in [4m[35m{parliament}[0m have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two - day investigation at the end of the month . 
(4) But [32m{the scandal itself}[0m is so convoluted that ruling - party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining [1m[31m{the opposition}[0m and those who favor leaving well enough alone . 
(5) `` [1m[31m{The opposition}[0m can be the most hurt because everyone already figures [1m[33m{the LDP}[0m is that kind of beast , '' says [35m{Shigezo Hayasaka , former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst}[0m . 
(6) But , [35m{he}[0m adds , `` [1m[34m{We}[0m ca n't tell where [32m{it}[0m will go at all because [1m[34m{we}[0m 're still in the middle of [32m{it}[0m . '' 
(7) [4m[31m{This time}[0m , [32m{the scandal}[0m centers on [3m[31m{donations made by the not - quite - mainstream pachinko parlor industry}[0m . 
(8) Pachinko , a kind of pinball , is [1m[34m{Japan 's}[0m favorite form of legal gambling . 
(9) [3m[31m{The donations}[0m so far appear to be small , especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in [3m[32m{the Recruit Co . influence - peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year}[0m . 
(10) But the implications could be great . 
(11) Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of [1m[34m{Japan 's}[0m underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders . 
(12) Recently [4m[34m{the industry}[0m has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe . 
(13) Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in [1m[34m{Japan}[0m . 
(14) To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory . 
(15) Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across [1m[34m{the country}[0m . 
(16) [3m[35m{Devotees}[0m pass hours , watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping , as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous , alone with [3m[35m{their}[0m thoughts . 
(17) At 500 yen -LRB- $ 3.60 -RRB- for a handful of balls , [36m{pachinko}[0m is a common pastime , and has been since [36m{it}[0m took root as cheap entertainment in the years after [31m{World War II}[0m . 
(18) But the total of all those pinging balls has created [4m[34m{an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen -LRB- almost $ 92 billion -RRB- , or nearly the size of Japan 's vaunted automobile industry}[0m . 
(19) And because [4m[34m{the pachinko industry}[0m is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion , some observers estimate the real income could be [34m{as much as 20 trillion yen}[0m . 
(20) If [34m{that money}[0m were being taxed , [34m{it}[0m could bring [1m[34m{the government}[0m a badly needed several trillion yen . 
(21) In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on [4m[34m{the industry}[0m with tougher restrictions . 
(22) Then , in 1988 , [3m[33m{a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko}[0m was fielded in [4m[35m{parliament}[0m . 
(23) [3m[33m{The proposal}[0m split [4m[34m{the industry}[0m in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose [3m[33m{the plan}[0m while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept [3m[33m{it}[0m or are neutral . 
(24) In August , [1m[36m{a conservative weekly magazine}[0m [3m[36m{reported}[0m that [1m[32m{a pachinko industry organization}[0m [4m[32m{donated}[0m [3m[32m{money}[0m to [1m[36m{Japan Socialist Party}[0m members . 
(25) [1m[36m{The magazine}[0m alleged that in [4m[32m{making}[0m [3m[32m{the donations}[0m , [4m[34m{the pachinko industry}[0m may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards , or [4m[34m{it}[0m may have been laundering money back and forth between [1m[36m{the JSP}[0m and [3m[34m{the North Korean residents ' organization , the Chosen Soren}[0m . 
(26) [3m[34m{The Chosen Soren}[0m and [1m[36m{the JSP}[0m immediately denied [3m[36m{the report}[0m . 
(27) And at first , neither [1m[31m{the opposition}[0m nor [1m[33m{the LDP}[0m wanted to pursue [1m[33m{the issue}[0m . 
(28) But the press kept [1m[33m{it}[0m alive ; as with [3m[32m{the Recruit scandal}[0m , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money . 
(29) Within a matter of weeks , less - conservative magazines reported that [1m[35m{members of the ruling LDP}[0m had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations . 
(30) So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions [1m[35m{the LDP members}[0m received amounted to bribes . 
(31) Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that [3m[34m{Chosen Soren}[0m had donated directly to [1m[36m{JSP}[0m members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to [1m[33m{LDP}[0m members . 
(32) [1m[36m{The JSP}[0m admitted Oct. 13 that [1m[36m{its}[0m members received about eight million yen from [1m[32m{the pachinko organization}[0m , and charged [1m[33m{LDP}[0m members with receiving 125 million yen -LRB- $ 880,000 -RRB- and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen . 
(33) On Friday , the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received [33m{five million yen}[0m from [4m[34m{the industry}[0m , including 450,000 yen -LRB- $ 3,175 -RRB- by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu . 
(34) No one has alleged that [33m{the donations}[0m were by [33m{themselves}[0m illegal . 
(35) Direct donations from either of [1m[35m{the residents ' organizations}[0m would be illegal because [1m[35m{the groups}[0m are defined as foreign , but [1m[35m{both groups}[0m deny making direct donations . 
(36) [1m[35m{They}[0m say it s possible some of [1m[35m{their}[0m members may be donating privately . 
(37) The issue is further complicated because although [1m[35m{the organizations}[0m represent [3m[31m{Korean residents}[0m , [3m[31m{those residents}[0m were largely born and raised in [1m[34m{Japan}[0m and many speak only Japanese . 
(38) That [3m[31m{they}[0m retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- [3m[31m{their}[0m parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when [1m[34m{Japan}[0m occupied Korea before [31m{World War II}[0m -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in [4m[36m{Japanese society}[0m . 
(39) Many Japanese think it only natural that [1m[35m{the organizations}[0m or [1m[35m{their}[0m members would donate to politicians , the way many Japanese do , to win favor or support . 
(40) [1m[35m{Both residents ' organizations}[0m admit to receiving some funding from abroad . 
(41) But [1m[33m{LDP}[0m members and supporters of [3m[33m{the prepaid card idea}[0m tend to speak in innuendo about [1m[36m{the JSP 's}[0m alleged donations , implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally .
