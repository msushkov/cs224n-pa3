(0) Comes with someone involved in case of [3m[34m{a 22 - year - old disabled woman in Florida}[0m . 
(1) They talk about [3m[34m{her}[0m current predicament . 
(2) A mind of toddler , [3m[33m{raped}[0m while in state care , pregnant , and forced in the spotlight when [1m[33m{Jeb Bush}[0m tried to get [32m{a guardian}[0m appointed for [3m[34m{her}[0m fetus . 
(3) Predicament goes hard enough to describe that . 
(4) To continue a pregnancy that [3m[34m{her}[0m lawyer says [3m[34m{she}[0m is not aware of but [1m[31m{the decision}[0m was n't based on the advice of [1m[33m{the governor}[0m . 
(5) Here 's [4m[35m{CNN 's Susan Candyioti}[0m . 
(6) Reporter : 
(7) [3m[36m{We}[0m know [3m[34m{her}[0m only by [3m[34m{her}[0m initial , [3m[34m{this mother -}[0m to - be , [31m{JDS}[0m . 
(8) Only 22 years old with no known family . 
(9) Police say [3m[34m{she}[0m has the mental capacity of a 1 - year - old . 
(10) According to court filing , [3m[34m{JDS}[0m has cerebral palsy and [3m[34m{she}[0m 's autistic . 
(11) [3m[34m{She}[0m did n't become pregnant by choice , [3m[34m{she}[0m was [3m[33m{raped}[0m , police say in [33m{a group home overseen by the state of Florida}[0m . 
(12) [3m[34m{JDS}[0m is now more than six months pregnant . 
(13) Since [3m[34m{she}[0m 's incapable of making [3m[34m{her}[0m own decision , [4m[32m{a Florida judge}[0m based [4m[32m{his}[0m decision on below to give birth on the recommendation . 
(14) Two doctors agreed [3m[34m{JDS}[0m is , `` in good health . '' 
(15) Two sonograms reveal , no obvious or significant fetal abnormalities . 
(16) Although , [3m[34m{JDS}[0m is autistic , [1m[36m{a guardian}[0m says [3m[34m{JDS}[0m appears to be responsive not just sitting in a semiconscious state all the time . 
(17) Still undecided , an appeal by [1m[33m{Governor Jeb Bush , who wants the guardian apointed for the fetus}[0m . 
(18) [1m[33m{He}[0m says [4m[33m{the unborn child}[0m must be protected . 
(19) However , a spokesman for [1m[33m{the governor}[0m says [1m[33m{he}[0m calls [1m[31m{the court ruling for JDS , not to abort the baby}[0m , compassionate and humane . 
(20) Last month in Miami , a judge ordered [1m[34m{an abortion for another severely disabled raped woman who had been living in a state - regulated home}[0m . 
(21) In that case , [1m[32m{the young woman 's}[0m mother approved [1m[34m{the abortion}[0m . 
(22) And in [3m[35m{this case}[0m , there are a lot of unanswered questions still . 
(23) For example , what will happen to [4m[33m{the baby}[0m , and what will [3m[32m{happen}[0m to [3m[34m{JDS}[0m ? 
(24) Of course , according to [1m[36m{the guardian}[0m , [1m[36m{she 's very worried about that , too}[0m , and [1m[36m{she}[0m has warned the court that [1m[36m{she}[0m hopes [3m[34m{the mother}[0m will be placed in [4m[34m{a better home}[0m when all of this is over , [4m[34m{one where she is far better protected than she was by the state in a home where police say she was raped}[0m . 
(25) [34m{Aaron ?}[0m 
(26) Well , two questions . 
(27) Do [3m[31m{they}[0m know who [1m[35m{the rapist}[0m is ? 
(28) That 's sort a yes or no , [34m{I}[0m suppose . 
(29) And the other is , Has [4m[31m{the state}[0m done anything ? 
(30) Is [4m[31m{it}[0m doing anything to tighten up security in these places with respect defenseless people are being attacked ? 
(31) Reporter : 
(32) Well , first of all , regarding [3m[33m{the rape}[0m , [3m[31m{they}[0m hope to find out who [1m[35m{the father}[0m is once [3m[34m{she}[0m gives birth because [3m[31m{they}[0m will analyze DNA from [4m[33m{the baby}[0m in order to try to determine paternity in [3m[35m{this case}[0m , and [1m[33m{the governor}[0m has ordered a panel of experts now to study this issue of security . 
(33) Far better security than is clearly needed for people such as [3m[34m{this woman , JDS}[0m , living in group homes . 
(34) Well , [3m[36m{we}[0m will wait for the report . 
(35) Thank [4m[35m{you}[0m , [4m[35m{Susan}[0m . 
(36) [4m[35m{Susan Candiotti in Florida .}[0m 
(37) Coming up on `` Newsnight , '' [4m[36m{a cease - fire in the Middle East}[0m , is there [4m[36m{one}[0m or is it lots of talk . 
(38) Actions say different . 
(39) [3m[36m{We}[0m 'll talk to a Palestinian legal representative , their legal adviser when [3m[36m{we}[0m continue from New York .
