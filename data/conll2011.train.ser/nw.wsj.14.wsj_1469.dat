(0) After several years of booming business with [35m{China}[0m , foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in [1m[31m{a decade}[0m . 
(1) The imposition of [36m{austerity measures , starting last October ,}[0m already had begun to pinch when [4m[34m{the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4}[0m and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter . 
(2) Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since [3m[34m{then}[0m , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects . 
(3) And [35m{Beijing}[0m has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export - oriented plants strapped for cash . 
(4) [36m{Givaudan Far East Ltd. , a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in China ,}[0m typifies [3m[35m{the problems}[0m . 
(5) [32m{Last year 's}[0m retrenchment dried up the working capital of Chinese factories . 
(6) [36m{The company 's}[0m sales [4m[35m{flattened}[0m during [3m[33m{1989 's}[0m first half . 
(7) [4m[34m{The June killings}[0m magnified [3m[35m{the problems}[0m . 
(8) In [1m[34m{Canton}[0m , [36m{Givaudan 's}[0m representative office received no orders in [3m[32m{June}[0m . 
(9) At first [1m[34m{it}[0m attributed [4m[35m{the slump}[0m to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in [3m[34m{August}[0m and September , [1m[32m{manager Donald Lai}[0m became convinced that business would be bad for many months . 
(10) `` Things have grown worse since [3m[34m{June 4}[0m , '' [1m[32m{Mr. Lai}[0m says . 
(11) [1m[32m{He}[0m predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from [32m{last year 's}[0m $ 3 million . 
(12) [3m[36m{The consumer - products and light - industrial sectors}[0m are bearing the brunt of [35m{China 's}[0m austerity measures , and foreign companies such as [36m{Givaudan}[0m that deal with [3m[36m{those industries}[0m are being hit the hardest . 
(13) But in general , all foreign - trading companies are feeling the pinch . 
(14) `` The import pie will shrink , '' says [1m[35m{John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist}[0m . 
(15) `` On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . '' 
(16) [35m{China 's}[0m foreign trade has gone in cycles during [1m[31m{the past decade}[0m . 
(17) The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985 - 86 , when [35m{Beijing}[0m imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange . 
(18) The current trough is expected to be much deeper , because [35m{Beijing}[0m has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation . 
(19) In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following [4m[34m{the June killings}[0m have been a big setback . 
(20) `` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says Raymond Wong , [35m{China}[0m manager for Mannesmann AG , a West German machinery - trading company . 
(21) Import growth from the year - earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in [3m[34m{August}[0m , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half . 
(22) In [1m[36m{the first eight months of 1989}[0m , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % [3m[36m{a year}[0m earlier . 
(23) The picture for [35m{China 's}[0m exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze . 
(24) Exports in [1m[36m{the first eight months}[0m grew only 9 % , to $ 31.48 billion , compared with a growth rate of 25 % [3m[36m{a year}[0m earlier , according to Chinese customs figures . 
(25) The threat to [35m{China 's}[0m balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in [35m{its}[0m foreign - exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings . 
(26) [4m[33m{The reserves}[0m dropped for the first time in recent years , to $ 14 billion in [3m[32m{June}[0m from $ 19 billion in April . 
(27) The trend has prompted [35m{Beijing}[0m to intensify efforts to curb imports . 
(28) In recent weeks , [35m{China 's}[0m leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities . 
(29) The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses . 
(30) [35m{Beijing 's}[0m periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping [35m{China}[0m export . 
(31) For example , [4m[32m{Nissho Iwai Corp. , one of the biggest Japanese trading houses ,}[0m now [3m[35m{buys}[0m [4m[31m{almost twice as many goods from China as it sells to that country}[0m . 
(32) Three years ago , [4m[31m{the ratio}[0m was reversed . 
(33) But [3m[35m{the strategy}[0m is n't helping much this time . 
(34) `` Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , '' says [1m[33m{Masahiko Kitamura , general manager of Nissho Iwai 's Canton office}[0m . 
(35) [1m[33m{He}[0m expects [4m[32m{the company 's}[0m trading business to drop as much as 40 % [3m[33m{this year}[0m . 
(36) For a short time after [3m[34m{June 4}[0m , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright . 
(37) [1m[31m{Many foreign trading offices in Hong Kong}[0m were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from Chinese trade officials urging [1m[31m{them}[0m not to sever ties . 
(38) [4m[36m{Even the Bank of China , which normally took weeks to process letters of credit ,}[0m was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about [4m[36m{the bank 's}[0m financial health . 
(39) But when [3m[31m{foreign traders}[0m tried to do business , [3m[31m{they}[0m discovered that the eagerness of Chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen . 
(40) The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of [35m{China 's}[0m national trading companies , which are among [35m{the country 's}[0m biggest importers . 
(41) Business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say . 
(42) [3m[31m{Shanghai Investment & Trust Co. , known as Sitco ,}[0m is the city 's main financier for trading business . 
(43) [3m[31m{Sitco}[0m had customarily [3m[32m{tapped}[0m the Japanese bond market for funds , but [3m[31m{it}[0m ca n't do [3m[32m{that}[0m any longer . 
(44) Foreign traders say [1m[35m{the company}[0m is strapped for cash . 
(45) `` [1m[35m{It}[0m has difficulties paying [1m[35m{its}[0m foreign debts , '' says a [1m[32m{Hong Kong}[0m executive who is familiar with [3m[31m{Sitco 's}[0m business . 
(46) `` How can [3m[31m{it}[0m make available funds for purchases ? '' 
(47) Foreign traders also say many of [35m{China 's}[0m big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit . 
(48) [31m{Albert Lee , a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales ,}[0m estimates that as many as 70 % of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months . 
(49) `` There are [3m[33m{virtually no new projects}[0m , and [3m[33m{that}[0m means no new business for us , '' [31m{he}[0m says . 
(50) Even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because [35m{Beijing}[0m will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown between 30 % and 40 % in the past few years . 
(51) And foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because [35m{China}[0m is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years . 
(52) Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that [35m{Beijing}[0m has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include [34m{steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics}[0m . 
(53) [34m{These}[0m have been among [35m{the country 's}[0m leading imports , [32m{particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly}[0m . 
(54) But [33m{the shortages}[0m also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices . 
(55) To stem speculation , [35m{Beijing}[0m imposed [1m[36m{ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year}[0m . 
(56) [1m[33m{Traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling}[0m do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto [1m[33m{their}[0m stock . 
(57) The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market . 
(58) But [35m{Beijing}[0m ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering [35m{the country 's}[0m export business . 
(59) [1m[35m{Mr. Kamm , the China trade expert ,}[0m estimates that as much as 50 % of Guangdong 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials .
