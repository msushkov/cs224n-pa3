(0) From the Sept. 30 - Oct . 4 issue of The Economist : 
(1) What defeated [1m[33m{General Aoun}[0m was not only the weight of the Syrian army . 
(2) The weight of [3m[33m{Lebanon 's}[0m history was also against [1m[33m{him}[0m ; and [3m[32m{it}[0m is a history [1m[36m{Israel}[0m is in danger of repeating . 
(3) Like [3m[33m{Lebanon}[0m , and however unfairly , [1m[36m{Israel}[0m is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration . 
(4) [1m[36m{Its}[0m best hope of acceptance by [1m[36m{its}[0m neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians . 
(5) Like [3m[33m{Lebanon}[0m , [1m[36m{Israel}[0m is being remade by demography . 
(6) In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims . 
(7) Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority . 
(8) Yet [1m[36m{Israel}[0m will neither share power with all these Arabs nor , says [1m[36m{its}[0m present prime minister , redraw [1m[36m{its}[0m borders closer to [1m[36m{its}[0m pre-1967 Jewish heartland . 
(9) By not choosing one of these options , [1m[34m{Israelis}[0m will condemn [1m[34m{themselves}[0m , as [1m[35m{the Maronites}[0m did , to perpetual war with the Muslims in [1m[34m{their}[0m midst , and so to the internal erosion of [1m[34m{their}[0m state . 
(10) Unlike [1m[35m{the Maronites}[0m , [1m[36m{Israel 's}[0m Jews will not let [3m[34m{themselves}[0m become the weakest force in a system of private armies ; [3m[31m{Jerusalem}[0m will [3m[35m{become}[0m Belfast before [3m[31m{it}[0m becomes Beirut . 
(11) But [3m[35m{that}[0m is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of [1m[33m{General Aoun}[0m .
