(0) There were a couple of indications earlier about how important [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m has become as an issue in the presidential campaign . 
(1) Everyone agrees [3m[34m{it}[0m needs fixing and if [3m[34m{it}[0m is n't reformed , [3m[34m{it}[0m will eventually run out of money . 
(2) [35m{George W. Bush}[0m [3m[33m{wants}[0m to modernize [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m , as [35m{he}[0m puts it , by allowing [34m{workers}[0m to take a small share of [34m{their}[0m Social Security , payroll tax , to increase [34m{themselves}[0m . 
(3) [4m[35m{Al Gore}[0m wants to maintain the existing system . 
(4) [4m[35m{He}[0m [1m[36m{says}[0m [4m[35m{he}[0m would save [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m by reducing the national debt and giving [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m extra money . 
(5) [3m[35m{ABC 's}[0m John Martin takes a closer look from the battleground state of [3m[32m{Missouri}[0m . 
(6) At a small robotics company in a [36m{St. Louis}[0m suburb , [1m[34m{the Blumers , father and son ,}[0m work side by side . 
(7) [35m{George Bush 's}[0m plan to allow [1m[34m{them}[0m to invest a small portion of [1m[34m{their}[0m Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market is where [1m[34m{they}[0m part ways . 
(8) [36m{I}[0m could do with it what [36m{I}[0m want . 
(9) If [36m{I}[0m made a bad decision , then falls back on [36m{me}[0m , and [36m{I}[0m do n't have to complain about anybody else messin' [36m{my}[0m money . 
(10) It 's retirement money . 
(11) It 's [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m money . 
(12) If you lose [1m[33m{it}[0m , [1m[33m{it}[0m 's gone . 
(13) The issue comes down to this -- will [1m[31m{voters}[0m believe [4m[35m{Al Gore 's}[0m promise to protect [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m the way [3m[34m{it}[0m is ? or will [1m[31m{they}[0m take a gamble and trust [35m{George Bush 's}[0m plan to privatize part of [3m[34m{it}[0m ? 
(14) [4m[36m{Some Missouri voters}[0m are not sure [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m will be there for [4m[36m{them}[0m , so [4m[36m{they}[0m are ready to take a risk . 
(15) [4m[34m{Mike Dubis}[0m is 29 , father of three . 
(16) Giving [3m[31m{all that money}[0m to [1m[31m{Uncle Sam}[0m to earn [1m[31m{his}[0m 2 % on [3m[31m{it}[0m or [4m[34m{me}[0m [4m[32m{turning}[0m around making 27 % or 30 % on [3m[31m{it}[0m , [4m[34m{I}[0m 'd have to go [4m[32m{that way}[0m . 
(17) [4m[32m{That way}[0m was a simple appeal . 
(18) [34m{I}[0m just want more of a say - so of what [34m{I}[0m can do with [34m{my}[0m own money . 
(19) At a union hall , [32m{retirees}[0m worry that [35m{Bush}[0m is gambling with [32m{their}[0m [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m benefits . 
(20) [33m{I}[0m do n't think nobody has the option to take [33m{my}[0m Social Security and invest [1m[35m{it}[0m in nothing . 
(21) [1m[35m{It}[0m 's mine ! 
(22) [4m[35m{Gore}[0m targets [33m{independents like Hank and Loretta Goehring}[0m to drive home the point that [3m[33m{the Bush plan}[0m will take $ 1 trillion out of [3m[34m{the system}[0m . 
(23) [33m{They}[0m got a phone message by [4m[31m{actor Ed Asner}[0m . 
(24) Hi , [4m[31m{this}[0m is Ed Asner . 
(25) But I do n't think we have enough money to cover [4m[33m{both promises}[0m . 
(26) [31m{Neither candidate}[0m says how [31m{he}[0m will [35m{guarantee}[0m [3m[34m{Social Security 's}[0m future , and both resist saying [35m{it}[0m will cost more money . 
(27) Do [3m[36m{you}[0m never see the need in the future to raise taxes or cut benefits ? 
(28) [3m[36m{I}[0m certainly hope not . 
(29) An [3m[35m{ABC News}[0m poll shows voters divided on who will best protect [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m , but [1m[32m{58 %}[0m support a plan like [35m{Bush 's}[0m . 
(30) In this era of stock market wealth , [1m[32m{they}[0m see [35m{his}[0m idea as an opportunity , not the end of [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m . 
(31) [1m[32m{John Martin}[0m , [3m[35m{ABC News}[0m , [36m{St. Louis}[0m . 
(32) There are a lot of complexities in [3m[34m{Social Security}[0m in [4m[33m{both of these plans}[0m . 
(33) If you go to [3m[35m{our}[0m website , abc.com , that may help .
