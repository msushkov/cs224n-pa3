(0) In the Palestinian territories [3m[34m{today}[0m , [4m[34m{violence on violence}[0m again . 
(1) [4m[34m{It}[0m began with [3m[33m{the bombing of a school bus carrying children of Jewish settlers}[0m . 
(2) [4m[34m{It}[0m ended with [3m[35m{one of the most punishing Israeli responses in weeks}[0m . 
(3) Here 's [32m{ABC 's Gillian Findlay}[0m . 
(4) For two hours [4m[31m{tonight}[0m , Israeli helicopters and ships [3m[35m{fired}[0m missile after missile on [31m{Gaza}[0m , with 50 missiles in all , hitting police buildings , Palestinian security buildings , several offices of [4m[33m{Yasser Arafat 's}[0m political organization . 
(5) Unlike previous attacks , [3m[35m{this one}[0m began without warning and early enough that people were still in the streets . 
(6) [31m{Gaza}[0m hospitals reported dozens of wounded , mostly bruises , doctors said , and shock .

(8) One of the Jewish settlements in [31m{Gaza}[0m .

(10) Shrapnel killed two parents and injured several children seriously . 
(11) [4m[35m{This road , a lifeline for the several hundred Jewish settlers who live here ,}[0m has been targeted dozens of times in recent weeks . 
(12) [3m[34m{Today}[0m , the Palestinian Authority was quick to deny any responsibility , pointing out [4m[35m{the road}[0m is patrolled by [3m[36m{Israeli soldiers}[0m . 
(13) [3m[33m{The incident}[0m took place in an area which is under [3m[36m{their}[0m control , under [3m[36m{their}[0m security , jurisdiction , and [3m[36m{they}[0m have to blame [3m[36m{themselves}[0m . 
(14) But after [4m[31m{tonight 's}[0m attack , [4m[36m{Israel 's Prime Minister}[0m said none of [4m[34m{this}[0m would have happened if [4m[33m{Yasser Arafat}[0m had not let known terrorists out of jail . 
(15) We find no way than to respond like any other free world democracy . 
(16) [4m[36m{Mr. Barak}[0m vowed the use of as much force as necessary to end this kind of violence . 
(17) Late tonight , in several Palestinian towns , the cry once more was for revenge . 
(18) [32m{Jillin Findley}[0m , Jerusalem .
