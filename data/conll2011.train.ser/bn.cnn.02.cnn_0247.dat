(0) Welcome back . 
(1) 25 minutes after the hour . 
(2) Time for the Cafferty file . 
(3) Good morning . 
(4) A crazy world we live in . 
(5) [4m[31m{The Supreme Court of the United States}[0m upheld [3m[32m{the toughest three strikes law in the country}[0m [3m[33m{yesterday}[0m . 
(6) [3m[32m{That}[0m 's [4m[34m{California 's}[0m . 
(7) [4m[31m{They}[0m rejected challenges to [3m[32m{the law of sentences of 25 years to life without parole for a man convicted of stealing some golf clubs and 50 years for a man who stole some videotapes}[0m . 
(8) The idea is if you have three felony convictions , you 're out of here . 
(9) The voters overwhelmingly passed [3m[32m{the law}[0m in 1994 to offset the liberal and lenient judges who let bad people off with nothing more than a slap of the wrist . 
(10) They appealed to [4m[31m{the Supreme Court}[0m on behalf of these two people . 
(11) Currently in [4m[34m{California}[0m , [3m[34m{7000 people}[0m serving 25 year to life sentences under [3m[32m{the three strikes law}[0m . 
(12) , 300 of [3m[34m{them}[0m are in there for things like petty theft . 
(13) 25 other states that have the three strikes law . 
(14) And that brings us to [4m[32m{the question}[0m . 
(15) It was a close vote . 
(16) 5 in [4m[31m{the Supreme Court}[0m . 
(17) Here is [4m[32m{the question of the day}[0m . 
(18) You can e-mail us at am@cnn.com . 
(19) [3m[32m{It}[0m 's designed to counter the kind of thing that I found in the New York newspaper this morning where [4m[33m{a Brooklyn woman who scalded her 4 - year - old to death in a bathtub}[0m , walked out of court a free woman [3m[33m{yesterday}[0m sentenced to [3m[35m{five years probation}[0m . 
(20) It took [4m[35m{the child}[0m three weeks to die in the hospital from the injuries [4m[35m{it}[0m suffered at the hands of [4m[35m{its}[0m mother and [4m[33m{she}[0m 's free . 
(21) [3m[35m{Five years probation for killing her 4 - year - old by scalding it to death in the bathtub .}[0m
