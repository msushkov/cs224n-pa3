(0) [3m[34m{The Pentagon}[0m denies US warships are steering clear of [3m[36m{the Suez Canal}[0m in the wake of [3m[32m{the apparent terrorist bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen}[0m although none has used [3m[36m{the canal}[0m , since [3m[32m{the attack on the Cole earlier this month}[0m . 
(1) [4m[36m{VOA 's}[0m Alex Belida reports security along [3m[36m{the Suez}[0m is being re-evaluated . 
(2) At the same time , [1m[31m{US forces in two gulf countries}[0m have been [3m[31m{put}[0m on [3m[33m{alert against possible terrorist action}[0m . 
(3) [3m[34m{Pentagon}[0m spokesman Ken Baken , says [1m[31m{US forces in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia}[0m have now been [3m[31m{placed}[0m on [3m[33m{threat condition delta , the highest state of alert}[0m . 
(4) [3m[31m{The move ordered Monday}[0m , follows the earlier decision to place US forces in Bahrain and Qatar on [3m[33m{the same delta status}[0m , because of terrorist threats . 
(5) US forces in [1m[35m{the Yemeni harbor of Aden}[0m were elevated to [3m[33m{delta}[0m immediately following [3m[32m{the deadly October 12th terrorist bombing of US destroyer Cole}[0m . 
(6) [4m[34m{Mr. Baken}[0m says the heightened alert in [1m[33m{Kuwait}[0m and [32m{Saudi Arabia}[0m , affects [1m[31m{some 10,000 US military personnel in those two countries}[0m . 
(7) [4m[34m{He}[0m says [3m[31m{it}[0m was ordered because of what [4m[34m{he}[0m termed credible threats , but [4m[34m{he}[0m says no targets were specified . 
(8) [4m[34m{The Pentagon spokesman}[0m is meanwhile disputing news reports saying the Defense Department has decided to order US Navy ships to temporarily stop using [3m[36m{the Suez Canal}[0m out of fear of terrorist attack . 
(9) [4m[34m{Mr. Baken}[0m says no such instructions have been given , but [4m[34m{he}[0m acknowledges [4m[35m{security along the canal}[0m is being constantly [31m{evaluated}[0m . 
(10) [3m[34m{We}[0m are evaluating with [4m[33m{the Egyptians}[0m . 
(11) Obviously , [4m[35m{the security situation in the canal}[0m , [3m[34m{we}[0m do [31m{that}[0m all the time . 
(12) So , with [4m[33m{the Egyptians}[0m we both have a very fundamental interest in keeping [3m[36m{the canal}[0m secure . 
(13) No US ships have [4m[32m{transited}[0m through [3m[36m{the canal}[0m since before [3m[32m{the October 12th attack on the US destroyer Cole in Aden}[0m , but [4m[34m{Mr. Baken}[0m says no ships were scheduled to make [4m[32m{the trip}[0m for several weeks . 
(14) [1m[34m{The badly damaged Cole}[0m has been towed out of [1m[35m{Aden Harbor}[0m and is being loaded aboard [1m[36m{a Norwegian owned heavy lift ship called the Blue Merlin}[0m . 
(15) [4m[34m{Mr. Baken}[0m , says no decision has yet been made on the route [1m[36m{the Blue Merlin}[0m will take to return [1m[34m{the destroyer}[0m to the United States for repairs .
