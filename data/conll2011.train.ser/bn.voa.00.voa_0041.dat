(0) [3m[31m{The US Navy}[0m has issued [1m[34m{a revised timetable of events leading to last week 's deadly bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden}[0m . 
(1) [35m{VOA}[0m [1m[32m{Pentagon}[0m correspondent Alex Belida reports , [1m[34m{the new timeline}[0m raises new questions about how [1m[31m{the apparent terrorist attack}[0m was carried out . 
(2) [3m[31m{The Navy}[0m now says [1m[36m{the blast}[0m occurred nearly two hours after [1m[35m{the destroyer}[0m had [3m[35m{moored}[0m for refueling in [3m[33m{Aden Harbor}[0m , not during [3m[35m{the mooring operation itself}[0m . 
(3) Originally [3m[31m{Navy}[0m officials said a small boat that assisted in securing [1m[35m{the ship 's}[0m lines or whose movements were masked by [3m[35m{the mooring operation}[0m pulled aside [1m[35m{the Cole}[0m and [1m[36m{blew}[0m up in [1m[31m{an apparent suicide attack}[0m . 
(4) [1m[33m{A Navy spokesman , Commander Greg Smith}[0m offers no new explanation of [3m[34m{the circumstances leading to the blast}[0m , saying [3m[34m{that}[0m is now a matter for criminal investigators . 
(5) However , [1m[33m{Commander Smith}[0m says , [3m[31m{the Navy}[0m remains firm in [3m[31m{its}[0m assessment that [1m[36m{the explosion}[0m was the result of [1m[31m{a terrorist attack}[0m and not a refueling accident , even though [1m[34m{the new time table}[0m confirms refueling was underway . 
(6) [3m[32m{That}[0m raises questions about how a single boat could have approached without raising the suspicions of armed guards posted as part of the heightened alert status required for [1m[35m{the Cole 's}[0m port visit . 
(7) [36m{Alex Belida}[0m , [35m{VOA News}[0m , [1m[32m{the Pentagon}[0m .
