(0) Finally this evening -- the auctioneers . 
(1) Here in [3m[34m{New York}[0m [1m[31m{today}[0m , [3m[31m{the gigantic international auction house Sotheby 's}[0m pleaded guilty to [1m[34m{price - fixing}[0m with [3m[32m{Christie 's -- its only real competition in an industry that does $ 4 billion in business every year}[0m . 
(2) [1m[34m{This}[0m is a case of the rich and the powerful stifling competition . 
(3) Here is [3m[33m{ABC 's}[0m Aaron Brown . 
(4) Sold for $ 200,000 . 
(5) [1m[32m{Diana Brooks}[0m was at home on center stage in the toney world of high - priced art . 
(6) As [1m[32m{President of Sotheby 's}[0m , [1m[32m{she}[0m often conducted the biggest , the highest profile auctions , like the Kennedy family treasures , [1m[32m{herself}[0m . 
(7) Sold for $ 95,000 . 
(8) [1m[31m{Today}[0m , [1m[32m{she}[0m took center stage in a far grittier place , pleading guilty to bilking hundreds of wealthy art patrons out of tens of millions of dollars . 
(9) Those charged engaged in classic cartel behavior -- price fixing , pure and simple . 
(10) [3m[35m{The cartel}[0m consisted of [3m[31m{Sotheby 's}[0m and [3m[32m{Christie 's}[0m . 
(11) [3m[35m{Arch rivals}[0m for nearly three centuries , [3m[35m{the two auction houses}[0m agreed to fix prices on what [3m[35m{they}[0m charged the buyers and sellers of high - priced art . 
(12) Even arch rivals , it seems , have a common bond . 
(13) [3m[31m{Sotheby 's}[0m and [3m[32m{Christie 's}[0m are all about money . 
(14) [3m[35m{They}[0m are dealing with [1m[36m{art , history and beautiful things}[0m , but at the end of the day , [1m[35m{people}[0m go to [3m[31m{Sotheby 's}[0m and [3m[32m{Christie 's}[0m because [1m[35m{they}[0m believe [1m[35m{they}[0m can get best price for [1m[36m{them}[0m . 
(15) [3m[35m{They}[0m have already agreed to pay more than $ 500 million to settle the civil suits spawned by [3m[35m{their}[0m crimes . 
(16) [1m[32m{Ms. Brooks , who could go to prison and will certainly be heavily fined}[0m has agreed to turn state 's evidence , turning against [1m[32m{her}[0m boss . 
(17) [1m[32m{She}[0m becomes Sammy `` the bull '' Gravano with better taste , and [1m[33m{the art world}[0m , well , while being more careful , perhaps , [1m[33m{it}[0m continues to do business with [3m[35m{the same two companies who for years swindled them}[0m . 
(18) I think the impact has been negligible . 
(19) Much to a lot of people 's surprise , business seems to be booming . 
(20) [3m[36m{Consignments}[0m still seem to be as high as [3m[36m{they}[0m were before [1m[34m{the scandal}[0m broke . 
(21) Which may be the clearest proof yet that the rich are different from the rest of us . 
(22) $ 1.3 million . 
(23) [36m{Aaron Brown}[0m , [3m[33m{ABC News}[0m , [3m[34m{New York}[0m .
