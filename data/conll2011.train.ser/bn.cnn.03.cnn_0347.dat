(0) There 's [31m{some shocking new information about the life of John F. Kennedy , both before and during his days in the White House}[0m . 
(1) [31m{The revelations}[0m are part of [3m[36m{a just published biography about the 35th President}[0m . 
(2) [4m[34m{Our}[0m Jonathan Karl takes a look inside the pages . 
(3) Reporter : 
(4) [31m{The revelations about Kennedy 's alleged affair with an intern}[0m make up just a couple lines in [4m[35m{historian Robert Dowd 's}[0m 700 - plus page biography . 
(5) [31m{The information}[0m comes from a single source , an interview with [35m{a former Kennedy staffer who says she does not remember the intern 's last name}[0m . 
(6) Although [4m[35m{he}[0m finds the reports of [4m[32m{Kennedy 's}[0m womanizing credible , [4m[35m{he}[0m believes new information about [4m[32m{Kennedy 's}[0m health problems is more significant . 
(7) [4m[32m{JFK 's}[0m public image was one of youthful vigor but in truth [4m[32m{he}[0m battled serious medical problems [4m[32m{his}[0m entire life . 
(8) Twice before becoming [4m[31m{President}[0m [4m[32m{he}[0m was so sick , a priest was brought in to give [4m[32m{him}[0m last rites . 
(9) While researching [4m[35m{his}[0m new book on [4m[32m{JFK}[0m , [4m[35m{Dallic}[0m uncovered previously sealed medical records that detailed the extent of [4m[32m{his}[0m medical troubles and the lengths [4m[32m{he}[0m went to conceal [1m[34m{them}[0m from the public . 
(10) There are many stories about politicians who used political influence to get out of military conflict , but [4m[35m{Dallic}[0m shows [4m[32m{he}[0m used [4m[32m{his}[0m family 's influence to get into [32m{the Navy}[0m just as America was on the verge of World War II . 
(11) In 1941 , [4m[32m{he}[0m flunked two military medical exams . 
(12) [4m[32m{His}[0m powerful father intervened , getting [33m{yet another exam}[0m . 
(13) Reading [34m{the report of his exam}[0m , one would think [4m[32m{he}[0m never had a serious physical problem in [4m[32m{his}[0m life . 
(14) [34m{It}[0m was a complete whitewash that would never have been possible without [4m[32m{his}[0m father 's help . 
(15) [4m[32m{Kennedy}[0m entered the [32m{Navy}[0m earning hero status for saving [4m[32m{his}[0m ship mates when [4m[32m{his}[0m boat Pt was sunk by the Japanese . 
(16) [4m[35m{Dallek}[0m says [4m[32m{Kennedy 's}[0m brushes with death , combined with the deaths of [4m[32m{his}[0m sister and brother , fueled the ambition that led [4m[32m{him}[0m to become the youngest person elected [4m[31m{President}[0m in American history . 
(17) [4m[32m{Kennedy}[0m told a friend before [4m[32m{he}[0m entered politics , you 've got to [3m[35m{live}[0m [3m[34m{every day}[0m like [3m[34m{it}[0m 's your last day on earth , [3m[35m{that}[0m 's what [4m[32m{I}[0m 'm doing . 
(18) [3m[32m{Jonathan Karl , CNN , Washington .}[0m 
(19) And [4m[34m{we}[0m 'll have much more on this story coming up later today on `` Wolf Blitzer Reports . ''
