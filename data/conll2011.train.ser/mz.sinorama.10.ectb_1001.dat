(0) Breaking down fences 
(1) In fact , [36m{the people of Macau}[0m are n't necessarily as ecstatic about [1m[32m{the handover}[0m as [36m{they}[0m are made out to be , and after more than 400 years of rule the Portuguese have left behind more than just European - style buildings , Portuguese food , and churches . 
(2) Macau University set up [33m{a " Handover Workshop "}[0m a few years ago , and [33m{it}[0m has proved highly popular . 
(3) Also , a number of books have been brought out by the government and by private publishers , exploring [1m[31m{the enclave 's}[0m history and identity . 
(4) Indeed , " identity " is precisely what [36m{the people of Macau}[0m have been looking for . 
(5) [35m{The presence of mainland China}[0m is what bonds [1m[33m{Taiwan}[0m and [1m[31m{Macau}[0m , yet [35m{it}[0m is also what keeps [1m[34m{them}[0m apart . 
(6) The spectacular handover ceremony , which took place in the global spotlight , is already over and done with . 
(7) Strolling through downtown Macau one notices prominent signs advertising popular Taiwanese snack - stops , like Dingtaifeng Dumpling Restaurant and Quickly Iced Drinks . 
(8) Business seems to be thriving at Margaret 's egg - tart bakery , whose brand name is known throughout the region and probably defines " [1m[31m{Macau}[0m " for many in [1m[33m{Taiwan}[0m . 
(9) For businesspeople , there seems to be little evidence of obstacles in the way of better [1m[33m{Taiwan}[0m - [1m[31m{Macau}[0m relations . 
(10) The excitement surrounding [1m[32m{the handover}[0m has died down , and life in [1m[31m{Macau}[0m goes on much as before . 
(11) The artificial boundaries and obstacles that people set up between each other must ultimately be removed by [34m{people themselves}[0m .
