(0) Outside [4m[33m{the white - walled headquarters of the socalled Society of Orange Workers}[0m , all seems normal in [1m[36m{South Africa 's}[0m abnormal society . 
(1) A pickup truck driven by a white farmer rumbles past with a load of black workers bouncing in the back . 
(2) Over at [1m[33m{Conradies , the general store ,}[0m a black stock boy scurries to help [35m{an elderly white woman}[0m with [35m{her}[0m packages . 
(3) Down the street , a car pulls into [1m[32m{the Shell station}[0m and is surrounded by black attendants . 
(4) But inside the white walls of [3m[33m{the Orange Workers '}[0m office -- just about the largest building in [31m{town}[0m , save for the Dutch Reformed Church and the school -- [1m[36m{South Africa 's}[0m neat racial order is awry . 
(5) A dozen white office workers fold [32m{newsletters}[0m and stuff [32m{them}[0m into envelopes . 
(6) White women serve tea and coffee , and then wash the cups and saucers afterwards . 
(7) White children empty the wastepaper baskets and squeegee the windows . 
(8) There is n't a black worker in sight . 
(9) Not in the kitchen , or the storeroom or the book shop . 
(10) `` If [3m[33m{we}[0m want to have [3m[33m{our}[0m own nation , then [3m[33m{we}[0m must be willing to do all the work [3m[33m{ourselves}[0m , '' says [1m[31m{Hendrik Verwoerd Jr. , son of the former prime minister and the leader of the Orange Workers , founded in 1980}[0m . 
(11) [3m[33m{They}[0m do indeed want [3m[33m{their}[0m own nation . 
(12) [32m{The pillars of apartheid}[0m may be trembling in [4m[32m{the rest of South Africa}[0m , with [1m[36m{Johannesburg}[0m opening [1m[36m{its}[0m public facilities to all races , blacks storming the all - white beaches of the Cape and [1m[36m{the government}[0m releasing seven leaders of [33m{the banned African National Congress}[0m . 
(13) But here in [31m{Morgenzon , a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal}[0m , [3m[33m{the Orange Workers}[0m are holding [32m{the pillars}[0m steady . 
(14) [3m[33m{The Orange Workers -- who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands , a hero of the Dutch - descended Afrikaners --}[0m believe that [1m[33m{the solution to South Africa 's racial problems}[0m is n't the abolition of [34m{apartheid}[0m , [1m[33m{it}[0m 's the perfection of [34m{apartheid -- complete and total separation of the races}[0m . 
(15) Here , then , is where [3m[33m{the Orange Workers}[0m have come to make [34m{apartheid 's}[0m last stand . 
(16) [3m[33m{Their}[0m idea is to create a city , first , and then [4m[31m{an entire nation}[0m -- without blacks . 
(17) [4m[34m{This}[0m may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa . 
(18) And the fact that there are only 3,000 card - carrying Orange Workers may put [3m[33m{them}[0m on the loony fringe . 
(19) But [3m[33m{their}[0m ideal of [4m[31m{an Afrikaner homeland}[0m , an all - white reserve to be carved out of [1m[36m{present - day South Africa}[0m , is a mainstream desire of the right - wing , which embraces about one - third of [1m[36m{the country 's}[0m five million whites . 
(20) Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long [4m[32m{ruminated}[0m on the need for a white homeland . 
(21) [3m[33m{The Orange Workers}[0m are just putting this [4m[32m{preaching}[0m into practice . 
(22) Thus , [3m[36m{farmer Johan Fischer}[0m , [3m[36m{his}[0m T - shirt and jeans covered in grease , crawls around under [3m[36m{his}[0m planter , tightening bolts and fixing dents . 
(23) On almost every other farm in [1m[36m{South Africa}[0m , black workers do the repairs . 
(24) But not here . 
(25) [3m[36m{Mr. Fischer}[0m plows [3m[36m{his}[0m own fields , sows [3m[36m{his}[0m own corn and sunflowers , and feeds [3m[36m{his}[0m own sheep . 
(26) Over at the fiberglass factory , [3m[34m{four white workers}[0m assemble water tanks on [3m[34m{their}[0m own , and in [3m[34m{their}[0m spare time [3m[34m{they}[0m build townhouses across the road . 
(27) On Main Street , [36m{Alida Verwoerd}[0m and [36m{her}[0m daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop , then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of [31m{the family}[0m . 
(28) Down by the stream , a group of Orange Workers puts the finishing touches on [3m[34m{a golf course}[0m . 
(29) If [1m[32m{whites}[0m want to play there by [1m[32m{themselves}[0m , says [1m[35m{consulting engineer Willem van Heerden}[0m , [3m[35m{whites}[0m should also build [3m[34m{it}[0m by [3m[35m{themselves}[0m . 
(30) `` If [3m[35m{we}[0m want to survive as a people , '' [1m[35m{he}[0m says , `` [3m[35m{we}[0m have to change our way of life . 
(31) [3m[32m{The Afrikaner}[0m must end [3m[32m{his}[0m reliance on others . '' 
(32) In [3m[33m{their}[0m quest to perfect [34m{apartheid}[0m , [3m[33m{the Orange Workers}[0m have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily to deny : The master ca n't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever . 
(33) `` If [34m{apartheid}[0m means [4m[34m{you}[0m want [4m[33m{cheap black labor}[0m and all the comforts that go with [4m[33m{it}[0m , but [4m[34m{you}[0m also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration , then these are two contradictions that ca n't go on forever , '' says [1m[31m{Mr. Verwoerd}[0m . 
(34) [1m[31m{He}[0m is sitting in [1m[31m{his}[0m living room , beneath a huge portrait of [1m[31m{his}[0m late father , Hendrik F. Verwoerd , [34m{apartheid 's}[0m architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966 . 
(35) Somewhere , [1m[31m{the son}[0m sighs , things went terribly wrong with [34m{apartheid}[0m ; today , whites even rely on [3m[31m{blacks}[0m to police [3m[31m{their}[0m separation . 
(36) `` People took [1m[31m{separate development}[0m as an opportunity to use [1m[34m{black labor}[0m without ever getting rid of [1m[34m{it}[0m . 
(37) But [1m[31m{my}[0m father meant [1m[31m{it}[0m to mean real separation , '' says [1m[31m{the son}[0m . 
(38) [3m[33m{The Orange Workers}[0m speak sincerely . 
(39) `` [3m[33m{We}[0m agree with world opinion that the status quo in [1m[36m{South Africa}[0m is morally wrong , '' says Pieter Bruwer , [3m[33m{the Orange Workers '}[0m chief scribe and pamphleteer . 
(40) `` [3m[33m{We}[0m must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly . '' 
(41) [31m{Morgenzon}[0m has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom . 
(42) According to [1m[31m{Mr. Verwoerd}[0m , the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in [34m{the eastern Transvaal}[0m , even before the blacks . 
(43) Then , when [31m{Morgenzon}[0m was incorporated in 1908 , the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in [31m{town}[0m ; [3m[36m{blacks}[0m could work there , but [3m[36m{they}[0m had to leave at night . 
(44) Today , [31m{Morgenzon}[0m is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads . 
(45) Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks , and many houses and storefronts are empty . 
(46) There are few factories and no mines . 
(47) [31m{It}[0m was an ideal place for [3m[33m{the Orange Workers}[0m to start [3m[33m{their}[0m new nation , unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined [34m{apartheid}[0m elsewhere in [1m[36m{South Africa}[0m . 
(48) So far , about 150 Orange Workers have moved here , spending nearly $ 1 million buying up property over the past three years . 
(49) Still , complete and total segregation remains elusive . 
(50) Just beyond the city limits is a shantytown of [3m[32m{2,000 blacks who are employed throughout the area}[0m . 
(51) Despite [3m[33m{the Orange Workers '}[0m intention to put [3m[32m{them all}[0m out of work , [3m[32m{they}[0m are in no hurry to leave . 
(52) [4m[36m{A young man}[0m called [3m[35m{July}[0m -LRB- [3m[35m{that}[0m 's when [4m[36m{he}[0m was born -RRB- , who works at the railroad station just up the street from [4m[33m{the Orange Workers office}[0m , points at [4m[33m{the whitewalled building}[0m and says matter - of - factly , `` We 're not allowed in [4m[33m{there}[0m , that 's all [4m[36m{I}[0m know . '' 
(53) [1m[35m{The 650 - or - so local whites who are n't Orange Workers}[0m are more troubled . 
(54) Try as [1m[35m{they}[0m might , [1m[35m{they}[0m just ca n't conceive of life without [36m{black workers}[0m . 
(55) `` Impossible , impossible , '' say [3m[31m{the Conradies , an elderly couple who have run the general store for decades}[0m . 
(56) `` [3m[31m{We}[0m ca n't do without [36m{their}[0m help , '' says [1m[34m{Mrs. Conradie}[0m . 
(57) `` Oh no . 
(58) [3m[31m{We}[0m need [36m{them}[0m and [1m[34m{I}[0m thank God for [36m{them}[0m . '' 
(59) Over at [1m[32m{the Shell station}[0m , [3m[33m{owner Rudi van Dyk , who doubles as Morgenzon 's mayor ,}[0m worries that [3m[33m{the Orange Workers}[0m have made [3m[33m{his}[0m town the laughingstock of [1m[36m{the nation}[0m . 
(60) `` What [3m[33m{they}[0m want [31m{us}[0m to do just is n't practical , '' [3m[33m{he}[0m says , noting that [3m[33m{he}[0m employs 16 blacks . 
(61) `` [3m[33m{I}[0m could n't afford to hire 16 whites . 
(62) The only Afrikaners who would be willing to work for this salary would n't know how to handle money . '' 
(63) Back at the [31m{Verwoerd}[0m house , [35m{Hendrik Sr.}[0m peers down over the shoulder of [1m[31m{Hendrik Jr}[0m . 
(64) [1m[31m{The son}[0m believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics , [31m{Morgenzon}[0m will boom . 
(65) `` [4m[31m{We}[0m urge [4m[31m{our}[0m people not to wait until [4m[36m{they}[0m have to fight for [4m[36m{their}[0m own nation , '' says [1m[31m{Mr. Verwoerd}[0m . 
(66) `` By populating a place now , [4m[31m{we}[0m make [4m[31m{ourselves}[0m a power any new government will have to take into account . '' 
(67) Curiously , [1m[31m{he}[0m compares [3m[33m{the Orange Workers}[0m to [33m{the ANC , which his father outlawed in 1960}[0m . 
(68) `` [33m{The ANC}[0m wo n't be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations , '' says [1m[31m{Mr. Verwoerd}[0m . 
(69) `` Likewise , no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners . '' 
(70) [1m[31m{He}[0m apologizes for sounding pushy . 
(71) `` Look , '' [1m[31m{he}[0m says , `` If [4m[32m{the rest of South Africa}[0m wants to [33m{have}[0m an integrated melting pot , [33m{that}[0m 's [4m[32m{their}[0m choice . 
(72) [4m[31m{We}[0m 'll leave [4m[32m{them}[0m alone . 
(73) [4m[31m{We}[0m just want to have [4m[31m{our}[0m own cup of [4m[35m{tea}[0m . '' 
(74) And [4m[31m{they}[0m will even serve [4m[35m{it}[0m [4m[31m{themselves}[0m .
