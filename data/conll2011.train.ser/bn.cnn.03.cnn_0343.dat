(1) [1m[35m{The test}[0m designed to measure the responsiveness of emergency workers to a terrorist attack . 
(2) It 's been a year and a half since [34m{a series of anthrax attacks}[0m killed [32m{five people}[0m . 
(3) No one has ever been arrested in connection with [31m{that case}[0m and [36m{the FBI}[0m is considering draining [1m[33m{a Maryland pond relating to evidence for those unsolved attacks}[0m . 
(4) [3m[34m{Kelli Arena}[0m reports . 
(5) Reporter : 
(6) [36m{The FBI 's}[0m interest in [35m{this state park in Maryland}[0m dates back to [3m[35m{last December}[0m . 
(7) Officials got [1m[32m{a tip}[0m back then that someone may have dumped equipment into [1m[33m{one of the park 's ponds}[0m . 
(8) [1m[31m{Officials}[0m say [1m[31m{they}[0m found [1m[32m{the tip}[0m significant because [1m[33m{the pond}[0m is about ten miles from Fort Dietrick where the Army experimented with anthrax . 
(9) Agents searched the area at least four times since then .

(14) After all , [31m{it}[0m is a murder investigation , multiple murder investigation , so [1m[36m{I}[0m 'm sure there are a number of avenues that they 're looking into . 
(15) Reporter : 
(16) According to government sources , agents in [3m[35m{December}[0m found a large plastic enclosed container with large openings on the side . 
(17) Officials say there is no evidence connecting anything found in [35m{the park}[0m to anthrax or [34m{the anthrax attacks}[0m , nor is there any evidence linking any individual to the deadly anthrax letters . 
(18) [36m{The FBI}[0m has said nothing publicly about anyone [36m{it}[0m may be investigating , but [33m{Attorney General John Ashcroft}[0m did refer publicly to [1m[34m{Steven Hatfield , a former researcher as a person of interest}[0m . 
(19) [1m[34m{He}[0m 's repeatedly proclaimed [1m[34m{his}[0m innocence and the spokesman told CNN -- 
(20) Well , [36m{the FBI}[0m can drain the Pacific Ocean but [36m{they}[0m wo n't find any evidence that [1m[34m{he}[0m was involved with [34m{the attacks}[0m because [1m[34m{he}[0m had nothing to do with [34m{the anthrax attacks}[0m at all . 
(21) Reporter : 
(22) Investigators involved in [31m{this case}[0m clearly frustrated .

(24) [1m[36m{LOU ?}[0m 
(25) [3m[34m{Kelly}[0m , where does [3m[32m{this investigation on Hatfield}[0m stand ? 
(26) [1m[36m{I}[0m mean , [1m[36m{I}[0m ca n't think of another case like [3m[32m{it}[0m . 
(27) [3m[36m{We}[0m 've got rather public statements by [3m[33m{law enforcement officials}[0m saying that [1m[34m{he}[0m is the suspect that [3m[33m{they}[0m think [1m[34m{he}[0m 's the guy and then [3m[36m{we}[0m have denial and then [3m[36m{we}[0m have this stuff . 
(28) It 's really -- really extraordinary . 
(29) Reporter : 
(30) Well , [33m{the Attorney General}[0m has been the only person that has even mentioned [1m[34m{Steven Hatfield 's}[0m name publicly and [33m{he}[0m called [1m[34m{him}[0m a person of interest , not a suspect .
