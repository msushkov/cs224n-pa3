(6) We happen to be at a very nice spot by the beach where this is a chance for people to get away from [1m[32m{CNN}[0m coverage , everything , and kind of relax . 
(7) Reporter : 
(8) Time to redefine normal again , which on [3m[35m{the homefront}[0m now seems to mean [33m{life as you live it only weirder}[0m . 
(9) [4m[35m{I}[0m 'm amazed at how unaffected [4m[35m{I}[0m am by things , how [4m[35m{I}[0m 'm still coming to work and doing the same things and going for a walk in the morning , and it just seems so strange to [4m[35m{me}[0m that it 's almost a parallel universe . 
(10) [4m[33m{More than 70 percent of Americans}[0m say [4m[33m{they}[0m are sad about [34m{the war}[0m .

(15) [32m{I}[0m do n't think [34m{it}[0m 's affecting our business as much as [32m{I}[0m was worried that [34m{it}[0m would , but you never know it 's going to happen . 
(16) If there 's [31m{any kind of terrorism that happens here}[0m , [32m{I}[0m think [31m{that}[0m would definitely put a damper on everything .

(23) Maybe [4m[36m{fewer}[0m are flying because [4m[36m{they}[0m worry about terrorism or [4m[36m{they}[0m worry about what [34m{the war}[0m will do to [4m[34m{the economy}[0m or maybe it 's everything . 
(24) There 's no one economic statistics to point to a downturn , it 's an overall feeling , a psychological feeling that everything is frozen , everything is on hold . 
(25) Consumers are n't spending , people are n't buying stock , everything is --
