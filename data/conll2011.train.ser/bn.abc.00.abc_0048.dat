(0) It will be a long time that it 's forgotten that [3m[33m{Mr. Bush}[0m won this the way [3m[33m{he}[0m did in [4m[34m{the Supreme Court}[0m . 
(1) Yes , it took a while last night to sort out precisely what [4m[34m{the court}[0m had [3m[36m{decided}[0m by such a narrow margin . 
(2) It is [4m[31m{case number 00949}[0m , and [4m[31m{it}[0m will be dissected for years to come . 
(3) Here 's [3m[31m{ABC 's}[0m Jackie Judd . 
(4) [4m[34m{The Supreme Court}[0m cleared the way for [3m[33m{George W. Bush}[0m to become President by interpreting [3m[35m{the principle of `` equal protection under the law ''}[0m in a way [4m[34m{it}[0m had never done before . 
(5) Equal protection cases often deal with discrimination based on race . 
(6) Here , [4m[34m{the court}[0m applied [3m[35m{it}[0m to counting voters ' ballots . 
(7) It 's now become clear , that as a matter of federal law , there have to be reasonably uniform standards for collecting [3m[34m{people 's votes}[0m and for interpreting [3m[34m{those votes}[0m . 
(8) In fact , [3m[35m{equal protection}[0m became the single issue [4m[34m{this divided court}[0m could find a majority to support . 
(9) [3m[36m{This}[0m was a stabilizing decision that restored order to a very chaotic situation . 
(10) And with that in mind , [4m[32m{the justices}[0m -- in a highly unusual move -- said [4m[32m{their}[0m ruling `` is limited to the present circumstances '' only , meaning [3m[36m{it}[0m applies just to [4m[31m{Bush v. Gore}[0m . 
(11) Not likely , say many legal experts . 
(12) What [4m[32m{they}[0m 've done now amounts to , what could be [3m[32m{a very important general principle}[0m , and take [3m[32m{it}[0m right back again immediately by saying , `` well , [4m[32m{we}[0m do n't intend to enforce [3m[32m{this}[0m in any other case . '' 
(13) Even those who support aspects of [3m[36m{the ruling}[0m still expect [3m[36m{it}[0m to affect many states with election laws similar to Florida . 
(14) [4m[33m{That}[0m raises a host of new questions , not just about recounts , but about different voting machines and differences between one city and another city within the same state . 
(15) Even [4m[33m{it}[0m raises questions about differences between citizens of different states . 
(16) [3m[36m{This historic decision}[0m will certainly be remembered as the one that put [3m[33m{a President}[0m in the White House , but [3m[36m{it}[0m may also become a decision that expands the judiciary 's role in future elections as well . 
(17) [1m[36m{Jackie Judd}[0m , [3m[31m{ABC News}[0m , [4m[34m{the Supreme Court}[0m .
