(0) The shock waves rushed across [31m{the country}[0m . 
(1) In Washington , where [4m[34m{the Gore campaign}[0m had steeled [4m[34m{themselves}[0m to lose , in Texas , where [35m{Bush}[0m and [35m{his}[0m team were convinced Democrats on [34m{the Florida Supreme Court}[0m were determined to win this one for [1m[31m{Mr. Gore}[0m . 
(2) [35m{Mr. Bush 's}[0m lawyers are rushing to the Supreme Court of the United States for assistance . 
(3) There was no major reaction on Wall Street . 
(4) Markets had closed . 
(5) Everywhere else in [31m{the country}[0m , [4m[33m{Americans}[0m were stopped momentarily in [4m[33m{their}[0m tracks to think of the mess that may lie ahead . 
(6) First question , how can [32m{Florida}[0m count the votes in 64 counties when it took this much to get a partial count in three ? 
(7) Let 's go back to ABC 's Erin Hayes . 
(8) Peter , here in [33m{the capital}[0m they are just about ready to go . 
(9) In [33m{Tallahassee}[0m in a courthouse , , [4m[35m{000 votes from Miami - Dade County}[0m . 
(10) [4m[35m{Those votes there}[0m had been preparations just in case . 
(11) If [4m[32m{we}[0m use 25 teams , then that roughly adds up to little less than 500 ballots per team , and [4m[32m{we}[0m figure [4m[32m{we}[0m could probably conclude that within an eight - hour time . 
(12) But then , for the rest of [32m{the state}[0m , some counties have n't separated the undervotes from the rest of the ballots . 
(13) Where to start ? and what to count ? 
(14) There was almost no guidance from [34m{the court}[0m on how to do it . 
(15) In tabulating what constitutes a legal vote , the standard to be used is the one provided by the legislature . 
(16) A vote shall be counted where there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter . 
(17) Exactly the kind of ambiguity that has kept the legal battle muddy and ongoing for 31 days . 
(18) [36m{We}[0m do n't know what the standards will be . 
(19) [36m{We}[0m do n't know who will count [4m[36m{them}[0m . 
(20) [36m{We}[0m do n't know whether or not [4m[36m{she}[0m will be counted in time for [4m[36m{them}[0m to count in the Electoral College . 
(21) [34m{The court}[0m was deeply divided . 
(22) Judge Wells said -- the concern among many is that this decision now leads so many questions . 
(23) T. would appear very little time to find the answers . 
(24) Thanks .
