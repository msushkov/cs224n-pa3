(0) [4m[34m{Lloyd 's of London}[0m said [4m[34m{it}[0m plans to clamp down on [4m[32m{the ability of underwriting syndicates to leave their annual accounts open beyond the customary three years}[0m . 
(1) [3m[33m{Underwriting syndicates at Lloyd 's , the world 's largest insurance market ,}[0m generally do n't close [3m[33m{their}[0m accounts for [3m[34m{three years}[0m , to allow for the filing of claims and litigation . 
(2) When such claims and litigation extend beyond [3m[34m{the period}[0m , [3m[33m{the syndicates}[0m can extend [3m[33m{their}[0m accounting deadlines . 
(3) [4m[34m{Lloyd 's}[0m said there are currently 115 open account years involving 68 of [4m[34m{the market 's}[0m roughly 360 syndicates . 
(4) [4m[32m{The open - year accounting practice}[0m `` is widely recognized within [4m[34m{Lloyd 's}[0m as of serious concern '' to the 31,329 member investors , who underwrite insurance at [4m[34m{Lloyd 's}[0m in return for premium and investment income , [4m[34m{Lloyd 's}[0m said . 
(5) [4m[32m{The procedure}[0m causes `` great uncertainty '' because [4m[31m{an investor}[0m ca n't be sure of [4m[31m{his}[0m or [4m[31m{her}[0m individual liability , [4m[34m{Lloyd 's}[0m said . 
(6) As a result , [4m[34m{the insurance market}[0m plans [4m[33m{new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open}[0m . 
(7) [4m[34m{Lloyd 's}[0m said [4m[34m{it}[0m expects to enact [4m[33m{new rules mandating the changes}[0m by year end . 
(8) Under [4m[33m{the new rules}[0m , [3m[32m{the officials}[0m will have to secure additional information and reports from actuaries , including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably . 
(9) In addition , officials will have to get quotes for certain reinsurance contracts and obtain approvals from other syndicate directors .
