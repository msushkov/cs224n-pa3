(0) New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in [4m[35m{September}[0m after shooting up [1m[34m{the month before}[0m , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models , [35m{the Commerce Department}[0m [3m[33m{reported}[0m . 
(1) Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion , after [33m{leaping}[0m 3.9 % in [1m[34m{August}[0m , [35m{the department}[0m said . 
(2) Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after [33m{the steep rise in August}[0m . 
(3) Moreover , a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in [3m[32m{manufacturing}[0m had contributed to perceptions that [3m[32m{the manufacturing sector of the economy}[0m had slowed to a crawl . 
(4) But many economists pointed to [32m{a 1.8 % September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category}[0m . 
(5) [32m{That}[0m `` suggests [3m[32m{the manufacturing sector}[0m is not falling apart , '' said [1m[33m{Sally Kleinman , an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York}[0m . 
(6) [1m[33m{She}[0m added , however : `` [3m[32m{It}[0m is not robust by any means . '' 
(7) While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down [31m{the orders total}[0m , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped [31m{it}[0m up . 
(8) Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . 
(9) Orders for military goods usually catapult in [4m[35m{September}[0m , government officials say , as [1m[32m{the Pentagon}[0m scrambles to spend [1m[32m{its}[0m money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . 
(10) While all the numbers in [3m[33m{the durable goods report}[0m were [1m[31m{adjusted}[0m for seasonal fluctuations , a [35m{Commerce Department}[0m analyst said that [1m[31m{the adjustment}[0m probably did n't factor out all of [36m{the wide - ranging surge in defense orders}[0m . 
(11) Without [36m{the increase in defense bookings}[0m , [4m[35m{September}[0m orders would have plummeted 3.9 % . 
(12) Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping . 
(13) Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4 % in [4m[35m{September}[0m , to $ 476.14 billion , after declining for the first time in 2 1/2 years in [1m[34m{August}[0m . 
(14) In July unfilled orders grew 1 % . 
(15) But [3m[31m{analysts}[0m noted that excluding [4m[36m{transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures -}[0m order backlogs have [1m[36m{declined}[0m for three months in a row . 
(16) `` [1m[36m{It}[0m means [1m[35m{we}[0m 're [4m[33m{eating}[0m into the bread that keeps [1m[35m{us}[0m going . 
(17) [4m[33m{That}[0m is a little disturbing , '' [1m[33m{Ms. Kleinman}[0m said . 
(18) `` [1m[36m{It}[0m also means if you have a real drop - off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going . '' 
(19) Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline . 
(20) Such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy . 
(21) But a [35m{Commerce Department}[0m analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year . 
(22) Still , Milton Hudson , senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in [34m{New York}[0m , said : `` If you look back a half - year or so the evidence was pretty good of [4m[34m{affirmative strength in the capital - goods sector}[0m . 
(23) Now at least there are question marks about [4m[34m{that}[0m , and without any question the pace of growth has slowed .
