(0) [1m[34m{International Business Machines Corp.}[0m [4m[32m{said}[0m [1m[34m{it}[0m [3m[31m{agreed}[0m to let [3m[34m{Motorola Inc.}[0m participate in [3m[33m{a semiconductor research project}[0m as part of [1m[34m{its}[0m effort to bolster [4m[33m{the U.S. semiconductor industry}[0m . 
(1) [1m[34m{IBM , which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here ,}[0m said [1m[34m{it}[0m [4m[34m{invited}[0m many other companies to participate as well , including some from Europe . 
(2) Jack Kuehler , [1m[34m{IBM 's}[0m president , said IBM is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific . 
(3) [1m[34m{IBM , which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work ,}[0m has become far more open about [1m[34m{its}[0m technology as [1m[34m{it}[0m has tried to rally [4m[33m{U.S. industry}[0m to head off the Japanese , who now dominate [1m[35m{the market for dynamic random access memory chips}[0m . 
(4) While [1m[34m{IBM , Armonk , N.Y. ,}[0m makes [3m[35m{the bulk of the DRAMs it uses}[0m , [1m[34m{it}[0m does n't make the equipment needed to produce [3m[35m{those chips}[0m . 
(5) And [1m[34m{IBM}[0m worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy . 
(6) Failure of U.S. equipment makers , [1m[34m{IBM}[0m fears , would leave [1m[34m{it}[0m dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with [1m[34m{it}[0m in other parts of the market . 
(7) [1m[34m{IBM}[0m also said [1m[34m{it}[0m expects to benefit from the expertise that [3m[34m{Motorola}[0m and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing . 
(8) [1m[34m{IBM}[0m already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor - manufacturing techniques . 
(9) [1m[34m{IBM}[0m said [1m[34m{it}[0m expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive . 
(10) A state - of - the - art plant cost $ 40 million in the [3m[32m{mid-1970s}[0m but [4m[31m{costs}[0m $ 500 million today because the technology is so complex . 
(11) And [1m[34m{IBM}[0m said [1m[34m{it}[0m expects [4m[31m{the costs}[0m to continue climbing . 
(12) [1m[34m{IBM , which said Motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21 - month agreement ,}[0m acknowledged some companies had [3m[36m{turned}[0m down [1m[34m{its}[0m invitation to join in . 
(13) But [1m[34m{it}[0m said [3m[36m{that}[0m was mainly because [3m[33m{the project}[0m may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s . 
(14) [1m[34m{IBM}[0m said [1m[34m{it}[0m thought more companies would become interested as [3m[33m{the project}[0m progresses . 
(15) [3m[33m{The project involving Motorola}[0m concerns a technique , called X-ray lithography , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips . 
(16) Currently , chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip , much as a camera produces an image on film . 
(17) But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and [1m[32m{the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light}[0m are long enough so that the images [1m[32m{they}[0m draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one . 
(18) X-rays , by contrast , travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light . 
(19) [1m[33m{X-rays}[0m have [1m[36m{problems}[0m , too . 
(20) [1m[33m{They}[0m can make the masks brittle and can pass through material [1m[33m{they}[0m 're not supposed to . 
(21) But , assuming [1m[36m{those problems}[0m can be overcome , [1m[33m{they}[0m should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as much as is contained in the four - megabit chips that are just reaching [1m[35m{the market}[0m and a million times what was possible in [3m[32m{the mid-1970s}[0m .
