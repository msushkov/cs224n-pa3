(1) First , though with what some believe is a case in point from Tampa , [4m[33m{Florida}[0m , [3m[35m{Samuel Arianna a former college professor in Florida who was arrested in February and charged of being a North America head of a Palestinian group Islamic Jihad}[0m .

(3) Only [3m[35m{his}[0m day in court wo n't come until January 2005 . 
(4) [3m[34m{Lawyers for the three men arrested with him}[0m say [3m[34m{they}[0m need that much time to go over the government 's evidence and prepare [3m[34m{their}[0m case . 
(5) Two of the indicted men are out on bond , but [4m[36m{Samiel Aryan and other defendant}[0m are held without bond which is to say [4m[36m{they}[0m will stay in jail until the trial starts in roughly 18 months . 
(6) [3m[33m{This conflict over individual liberty and national security}[0m is hardly new . 
(7) President Lincoln dealt with [3m[33m{it}[0m during the civil war , F.D.R. did in World War II , and it is often true that decisions made in the heat of a moment , a war or after an attack [4m[32m{look}[0m pretty good at the time , not so good as time passes . 
(8) Whether [4m[32m{that}[0m is true now , we can not say . 
(9) [4m[34m{Others}[0m , however , have thoughts and [3m[36m{Mr. Barr}[0m is among [4m[34m{them}[0m , [3m[36m{a Republican from the state of Georgia , former prosecutor and about the last person on the planet that you would ever call a blying liberal}[0m .
