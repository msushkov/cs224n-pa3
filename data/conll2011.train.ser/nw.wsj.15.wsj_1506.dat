(0) [3m[35m{The U.S.}[0m is [3m[34m{required}[0m to notify [33m{foreign dictators}[0m if [3m[35m{it}[0m knows of coup plans likely to endanger [33m{their}[0m lives , government officials said . 
(1) [3m[34m{The notification policy}[0m was part of [1m[31m{a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee}[0m . 
(2) The existence of [1m[31m{the guidelines}[0m has become known since [3m[31m{President Bush}[0m disclosed [1m[31m{them}[0m privately to [4m[35m{seven Republican senators}[0m at [4m[34m{a White House meeting}[0m last Monday . 
(3) [31m{Officials familiar with the meeting}[0m said [3m[31m{Mr. Bush}[0m cited [3m[34m{the policy}[0m as an example of the sort of congressional requirements [4m[33m{the administration}[0m contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as [32m{this month 's}[0m futile effort to oust [3m[33m{Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega}[0m . 
(4) According to [31m{the officials}[0m , [3m[31m{Mr. Bush}[0m even read to the [4m[35m{senators}[0m [4m[31m{selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines}[0m . 
(5) [31m{They}[0m said [1m[34m{the president}[0m conceded [3m[34m{the notification requirement}[0m did n't affect [1m[34m{his}[0m decision to lend only minor support to [32m{this month 's}[0m [3m[36m{Panama}[0m coup effort . 
(6) No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because [3m[35m{the U.S.}[0m did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill [3m[33m{Mr. Noriega}[0m , but merely sought to imprison [3m[33m{him}[0m . 
(7) What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that [3m[34m{the notification requirement}[0m is likely to be dropped from [1m[31m{the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House}[0m . 
(8) [34m{The rewriting}[0m was launched at [3m[33m{a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders}[0m [3m[32m{Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules}[0m . 
(9) However , [31m{the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News ,}[0m is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure [34m{Congress}[0m . 
(10) [31m{It}[0m has reopened the bitter wrangling between [4m[33m{the White House}[0m and [34m{Congress}[0m over who is responsible for [3m[36m{the failure to oust Mr. Noriega}[0m and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad . 
(11) [4m[32m{A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman , Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- ,}[0m charged that [31m{the disclosure}[0m is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for [3m[36m{the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama}[0m . 
(12) [4m[32m{The statement}[0m added , `` [3m[31m{Someone}[0m has regrettably chosen to selectively [33m{summarize}[0m [4m[31m{portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government}[0m . 
(13) Not only does [33m{this}[0m come close to a violation of law , [33m{it}[0m violates the trust [3m[34m{we}[0m have all worked to develop . '' 
(14) [3m[35m{Sen. Boren}[0m said , `` It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help [3m[35m{the country}[0m in the future . 
(15) [3m[35m{I}[0m 've invited [3m[31m{the president}[0m to send [3m[31m{his}[0m suggestions to [4m[32m{the committee}[0m . '' 
(16) [1m[35m{Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine , the panel 's vice chairman ,}[0m said of [31m{the disclosure}[0m that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in [4m[33m{the White House}[0m who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . '' 
(17) [3m[35m{Sen. Boren}[0m said [4m[32m{the committee}[0m could n't defend [4m[32m{itself}[0m by [4m[36m{making}[0m [1m[32m{the documents}[0m public because [4m[36m{that}[0m would violate classification rules . 
(18) But [3m[35m{the chairman}[0m and other committee members stressed that [35m{the notification guideline}[0m was n't imposed on [4m[33m{the White House}[0m by [34m{a meddling Congress}[0m . 
(19) Instead , both congressional and administration officials agreed , [35m{it}[0m grew out of talks about coup - planning in [3m[36m{Panama}[0m that were initiated by [4m[33m{the administration}[0m in July 1988 and stretched into last October . 
(20) [3m[34m{The guideline}[0m was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how [3m[35m{the U.S.}[0m might operate during foreign coups in light of [32m{the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations}[0m . 
(21) In fact , yesterday [4m[33m{the administration}[0m and [34m{Congress}[0m were still differing on what had been agreed to . 
(22) One administration official said notification was [3m[34m{required}[0m even if [3m[35m{the U.S.}[0m `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life . 
(23) But a congressional source close to [4m[32m{the panel}[0m said [3m[34m{the rule}[0m only covered coup plans directly involving [3m[35m{the U.S.}[0m . 
(24) Although [4m[34m{the notification guideline}[0m was n't carried out in [32m{this month 's}[0m coup attempt , some administration officials argue that [4m[34m{it}[0m may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in [3m[36m{Panama}[0m . 
(25) One senior administration official called [3m[34m{the guideline}[0m `` outrageous '' and said [3m[34m{it}[0m could make [36m{U.S. operatives}[0m reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear [36m{they}[0m may get into legal trouble . 
(26) The issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because [4m[33m{the Reagan administration}[0m had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new [3m[36m{Panama}[0m coup efforts . 
(27) In addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a [4m[33m{White House}[0m desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign . 
(28) Though [32m{the assassination ban}[0m is a White House order that [34m{Congress}[0m never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over [32m{its}[0m interpretation . 
(29) Last week , [4m[31m{Central Intelligence Agency}[0m Director William Webster publicly called on [34m{Congress}[0m to provide new interpretations of [32m{the assassination order}[0m that would permit [3m[35m{the U.S.}[0m more freedom to act in coups . 
(30) [4m[33m{The administration}[0m has reacted to criticism that [4m[33m{it}[0m mishandled [4m[36m{the latest coup attempt}[0m by seeking to blame [34m{Congress}[0m for restrictions [4m[33m{the White House}[0m said have hampered [4m[33m{its}[0m freedom of action . 
(31) However , last week [1m[33m{Mr. Webster 's}[0m two top [4m[31m{CIA}[0m deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered [4m[31m{the spy agency 's}[0m role in [4m[36m{the coup attempt in Panama}[0m . 
(32) Nevertheless , [4m[33m{the administration 's}[0m criticisms appeared to have made some headway with [4m[35m{Sens. Boren and Cohen}[0m after [4m[35m{their}[0m [3m[32m{Oct. 12}[0m meeting with [1m[34m{the president}[0m . 
(33) The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines , without changing [32m{the basic assassination ban}[0m , to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders . 
(34) The new argument over [3m[34m{the notification guideline}[0m , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed .
