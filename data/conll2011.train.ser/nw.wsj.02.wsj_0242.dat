(0) Some U.S. allies are complaining that [4m[31m{President Bush}[0m is pushing [35m{conventional - arms talks}[0m too quickly , creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of Western Europe for years . 
(1) Concerns about the pace of [35m{the Vienna talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons , as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central Europe --}[0m also are being registered at [3m[33m{the Pentagon}[0m . 
(2) [4m[31m{Mr. Bush}[0m has called for an agreement by next September at the latest . 
(3) But some American defense officials believe [4m[32m{the North Atlantic Treaty Organization}[0m should take more time to examine the long - term implications of the options being considered . 
(4) For one thing , [3m[33m{Pentagon}[0m officials , who asked not to be identified , worry that [4m[33m{the U.S.}[0m will have a much tougher time persuading [1m[31m{Europeans}[0m to keep some short - range nuclear weapons on [1m[31m{their}[0m soil once Soviet armored forces are thinned out . 
(5) At the same time , [4m[36m{they}[0m contend that a reduction of [4m[32m{NATO}[0m forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless [34m{the West}[0m retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in [3m[36m{Europe}[0m . 
(6) Allies concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller [4m[32m{NATO}[0m allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered [35m{the most complex arms - control talks ever attempted}[0m . 
(7) So far , no ally has complained openly , preserving the impression that [4m[32m{NATO}[0m is in line with the [4m[31m{Bush}[0m position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with [4m[32m{NATO}[0m is [34m{the West 's}[0m top bargaining priority . 
(8) But even though [4m[32m{NATO}[0m negotiators have only 10 months left under the [4m[31m{Bush}[0m timetable , [3m[31m{they}[0m are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank ? '' 
(9) Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined . 
(10) Tanks currently are defined as armored vehicles weighing 25 tons or more that carry large guns . 
(11) [32m{The Soviets}[0m complicated [3m[35m{the issue}[0m by offering to [31m{include}[0m light tanks , which are as light as 10 tons . 
(12) Oleg A. Grinevsky , the chief Soviet negotiator in [35m{the conventional - arms talks}[0m , argued that [31m{this}[0m would mean [32m{the Soviets}[0m would have to destroy some 1,800 tanks , while [4m[33m{the U.S.}[0m would lose none because [4m[33m{it}[0m has no light tanks in [3m[36m{Europe}[0m . 
(13) But [3m[35m{the issue}[0m is stickier than [3m[35m{it}[0m seems . 
(14) [4m[35m{France , Britain and Italy}[0m all have light tanks [4m[35m{they}[0m would like to keep out of [35m{the talks}[0m . 
(15) And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed at blocking [4m[33m{the U.S.}[0m from developing lighter , more transportable , high - technology tanks . 
(16) Defining combat aircraft is even tougher . 
(17) [32m{The Soviets}[0m insisted that aircraft be brought into [35m{the talks}[0m , then argued for exempting [4m[34m{some 4,000 Russian planes}[0m because [4m[34m{they}[0m are `` solely defensive . '' 
(18) [4m[32m{NATO}[0m has n't budged from [4m[32m{its}[0m insistence that any gun - carrying plane has offensive capability . 
(19) [3m[32m{The dispute over that issue}[0m , according to one U.S. official , is a `` potential treaty stopper , '' and only [4m[31m{President Bush}[0m and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able to resolve [3m[32m{it}[0m . 
(20) Accounting problems raise more knotty issues . 
(21) [36m{Greece and Turkey}[0m , for example , are suspected of overstating [36m{their}[0m arsenals in hopes that [36m{they}[0m can emerge from the arms - reduction treaty with large remaining forces to deter [36m{each other}[0m . 
(22) [33m{Other nations}[0m are n't sure how many weapons [33m{they}[0m have in [33m{their}[0m own arsenals . 
(23) `` It 's just going to be sloppy , both on [4m[32m{our}[0m side and [3m[34m{theirs -LCB- the Warsaw Pact 's -RCB-}[0m , '' says one [4m[32m{NATO}[0m analyst . 
(24) So far , neither the [4m[31m{Bush}[0m administration nor arms - control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than [4m[31m{President Bush}[0m has allowed . 
(25) They argue that the bigger danger would be that [34m{the West}[0m would delay action so long that [32m{the Soviets}[0m might back away from the current conciliatory attitude . 
(26) `` So what if you miss 50 tanks somewhere ? '' asks [1m[32m{Rep. Norman Dicks -LRB- D. , Wash. -RRB- , a member of the House group that visited the talks in Vienna}[0m . 
(27) `` The bottom line is that if [4m[32m{we}[0m can get that [3m[34m{-LCB- Warsaw Pact -RCB-}[0m superiority brought down to parity , [4m[32m{we}[0m ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible . 
(28) [1m[32m{I}[0m worry more about things becoming so unraveled on [3m[34m{the other side}[0m that [3m[34m{they}[0m might become unable to negotiate .
