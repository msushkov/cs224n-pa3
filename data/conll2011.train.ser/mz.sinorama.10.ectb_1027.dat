(0) One day , [3m[35m{Martine}[0m mentioned to [3m[36m{us}[0m that [4m[35m{Chien - chien}[0m was a little cross-eyed . 
(1) However , [3m[35m{she}[0m said [3m[36m{we}[0m were not to worry because [31m{children 's}[0m eyes usually correct [4m[34m{themselves}[0m as [31m{they}[0m get older . 
(2) To ease [3m[36m{our}[0m minds , [3m[35m{she}[0m had already taken [4m[35m{Chien - chien}[0m to see [3m[35m{her}[0m uncle , an ophthalmologist . 
(3) If [4m[35m{Chien - chien}[0m would visit [4m[31m{him}[0m again four or five times at two - week intervals , everything would be fine . 
(4) When [3m[36m{we}[0m asked [3m[35m{her}[0m about [4m[32m{the fee}[0m , [3m[35m{she}[0m would only say that [4m[32m{it}[0m should n't be much . 
(5) In fact , [3m[35m{she}[0m never did tell [3m[36m{us}[0m . 
(6) Usually , nannies view [32m{sick children}[0m as an annoyance because [32m{they}[0m require more care , and often must be given medication . 
(7) As a result , most nannies expect that [3m[34m{a child 's}[0m family will take care of [3m[34m{it}[0m when [3m[34m{it}[0m is sick . 
(8) But [3m[35m{Martine}[0m was different . 
(9) When the weather turned cool and [4m[35m{Chien - chien}[0m came down with a fever , [3m[35m{Martine}[0m called [4m[36m{my}[0m wife to [4m[33m{offer}[0m to keep [4m[35m{Chien - chien}[0m for the night . 
(10) [3m[35m{She}[0m told [4m[36m{my}[0m wife that [3m[35m{she}[0m had been a nurse and that taking [4m[35m{Chien - chien}[0m home in the cold night air might worsen [4m[35m{her}[0m chill . 
(11) [4m[36m{My}[0m wife , who had been hoping to take care of [3m[36m{our}[0m sick daughter [33m{herself}[0m when [33m{she}[0m got home from work , naturally declined [3m[35m{her}[0m kind offer . 
(12) In this way , [3m[36m{we}[0m became more and more comfortable -LRB- and more and more grateful -RRB- having [3m[35m{Martine}[0m as [4m[35m{Chien - chien 's}[0m nanny . 
(13) [4m[36m{I}[0m think [3m[35m{Martine}[0m treated [4m[35m{Chien - chien}[0m just as if [4m[35m{she}[0m were [3m[35m{her}[0m own child . 
(14) [3m[36m{Our}[0m daughter is now three years old and attends a pre-school near [3m[36m{our}[0m home . 
(15) [4m[35m{Chien - chien 's}[0m teacher has told [4m[36m{my}[0m wife that [4m[35m{Chien - chien 's}[0m French is very good . 
(16) Perhaps because [3m[36m{our}[0m little " foreigner " now speaks French , [4m[35m{she}[0m gets along very well with [4m[35m{her}[0m classmates ; [34m{they all}[0m remember [4m[35m{her}[0m French name , Elodie , and let [4m[35m{her}[0m know that [4m[36m{I}[0m 'm there when [34m{they}[0m see [4m[36m{me}[0m coming to pick [4m[35m{her}[0m up after school . 
(17) [3m[36m{We}[0m owe all of this to [3m[35m{Martine}[0m . 
(18) [3m[36m{We}[0m were lucky to find [3m[35m{someone so skilled in the art of being a nanny}[0m . 
(19) [3m[35m{She}[0m helped [3m[36m{us}[0m so much . 
(20) Thank [3m[35m{you}[0m , [3m[35m{Martine}[0m ! 
(21) p. 111 
(22) [4m[35m{Chien - chien}[0m and [3m[35m{Martine}[0m at the EuroDisney in Paris .
