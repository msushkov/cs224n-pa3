(0) [3m[31m{The nations of southern Africa}[0m know a lot about managing elephants ; [3m[31m{their}[0m herds are thriving . 
(1) But [1m[31m{the nations of Europe and North America}[0m have decided [1m[31m{they}[0m know better . 
(2) At this week 's U.N. conference in Lausanne , [1m[31m{they}[0m imposed [3m[32m{a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies}[0m . 
(3) A Zimbabwean delegate argued that [3m[32m{the ban}[0m would `` guarantee the extinction of the elephant . '' 
(4) Legitimate ranchers , who have an interest in preserving [1m[36m{the herds}[0m , would go out of business . 
(5) Poachers would control the underground trade . 
(6) Many delegates were willing to craft [1m[34m{a compromise}[0m , but U.S. delegate Constance Harriman and others thundered [1m[34m{that}[0m down . 
(7) The Greens from the First World wanted a morality play , not a negotiation . 
(8) Fortunately , [3m[31m{the nations of southern Africa}[0m have n't totally surrendered [3m[31m{their}[0m sovereignty . 
(9) [1m[33m{Five countries}[0m announced [1m[33m{they}[0m would not honor what one Zimbabwean delegate wryly called [3m[32m{the `` made in Switzerland '' solution}[0m . 
(10) In fact , [1m[33m{they}[0m seemed a mite resentful . 
(11) The director of Zimbabwe 's Wildlife Department [36m{described}[0m [1m[35m{American conservationists}[0m as `` fat little puppies from urban environments who do n't know a thing about Africa . '' 
(12) [36m{That}[0m 's not fair ; [1m[35m{they}[0m 're not all fat .
