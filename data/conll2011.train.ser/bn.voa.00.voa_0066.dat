(0) Let 's go to [33m{Russia}[0m right now [3m[35m{Joe}[0m , where [4m[36m{Vladimir Putin who still remains something of an enigmatic presence in the Russian political scene since he took office at the beginning of the year 2000}[0m , is apparently under siege yet again by [34m{revelations that the Russians might possibly have been able to rescue those trapped sailors in the Kursk submarine because some of them evidently survived and it 's apparent that the Russian military suppressed information about what had happened or even distorted it , and was singularly slow in taking up offers of assistance from the Norwegians and the British}[0m to help . 
(1) What impact do [3m[35m{you}[0m think [34m{this new revelation}[0m has on [4m[36m{Putin 's}[0m political stature ? 
(2) Oh , [3m[35m{I}[0m think [34m{it}[0m is another step in a diminution of [4m[36m{Putin}[0m . 
(3) [3m[35m{I}[0m think a number of things have happened ; 
(4) [4m[36m{His}[0m attempt to restore the image of [33m{Russia as a great power}[0m has , [3m[35m{I}[0m think backfired generally . 
(5) [4m[36m{he}[0m plunged [3m[34m{Milosevic}[0m long after it was clear that [3m[34m{he}[0m was finished . 
(6) [4m[36m{He}[0m has tried to form a strategic relationship with China and India , but this [3m[35m{I}[0m think has reflected in a much more dramatic way , the weakness of [4m[36m{Putin}[0m . 
(7) After all , you 've got to remember that when [3m[33m{the Kursk}[0m [1m[31m{went}[0m down , [4m[36m{he}[0m was on vacation in the Black Sea and did n't bother even to come back to Moscow , let alone going to Mermonsk at the scene of [1m[31m{the disaster}[0m and [4m[31m{they}[0m [4m[32m{held}[0m back for days before [4m[31m{they}[0m requested help from [4m[35m{Norwegian and British experts}[0m and those kind of thing , and [3m[35m{I}[0m think that there is a sense that [4m[32m{it}[0m may have contributed to [1m[31m{the disaster}[0m . 
(8) [31m{Tom}[0m , what 's the thinking in [4m[34m{the administration}[0m of [4m[36m{Putin 's}[0m performance so far ? 
(9) Very disappointing . 
(10) [4m[36m{Putin}[0m , it 's clear [4m[36m{he}[0m is no new style Democrat , to put it mildly . 
(11) [4m[36m{This}[0m is a man who still behaves like a KGB operator rather than a ... which , of course , [4m[36m{he}[0m was . 
(12) Yeah , for many , many years at a high level , than a President of a country trying to grapple with democracy . 
(13) [31m{I}[0m think [4m[34m{the Clinton administration}[0m [4m[34m{it}[0m was hopeful for [32m{Boris Yeltsin}[0m and then [4m[34m{it}[0m got disappointed in [32m{Yeltsin}[0m and then [4m[34m{they}[0m thought that reluctantly [4m[36m{Mr. Putin}[0m was a man that [4m[34m{they}[0m could do business with , to coin former Prime Minister of Britain Margaret Thatcher 's phrase about Mikhail Gorbachov , but [4m[36m{Putin}[0m [1m[32m{is}[0m disappointing [3m[36m{the United States government}[0m . 
(14) [3m[36m{They}[0m wo n't say [1m[32m{that}[0m of course , but [4m[36m{he}[0m has turned out to be a disappointment , and [31m{I}[0m agree with [3m[35m{Joe}[0m , [31m{I}[0m think [34m{these latest revelations that 23 sailors on the Kursk survived several days and theoretically might have been saved , had the Russians gotten off the dime and asked for help sooner}[0m , [31m{I}[0m think are devastating . 
(15) And David , [31m{I}[0m think it 's important the views that [31m{I}[0m think is gaining headway in [4m[34m{the Administration}[0m and voiced generally is that [4m[36m{Putin}[0m is a bureaucrat and [4m[36m{he}[0m runs [33m{the government}[0m in a bureaucratic kind of way and that [33m{it}[0m has no chance whatever of rebuilding the Russian economy and the Russian political stability , and that a continuing decline appears to be in the cards for [33m{Russia}[0m under [4m[36m{his}[0m leadership .
