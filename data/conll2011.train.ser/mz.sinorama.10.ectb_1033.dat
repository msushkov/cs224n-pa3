(0) Questions concerning the proper role and jurisdiction of [32m{the MJIB}[0m have reopened public debate on political surveillance . 
(1) [32m{The MJIB}[0m is responsible for both political intelligence gathering and criminal investigations , and is nominally under [33m{the Ministry of Justice}[0m . 
(2) [32m{Its}[0m work overlaps with that of [35m{the NSB}[0m , and the existence of two different chains of command inevitably creates problems . 
(3) The IRA has pointed out , for example , that [32m{MJIB}[0m investigators often receive oral instructions from [35m{the NSB}[0m to collect information on a particular political party . 
(4) [33m{The Ministry of Justice}[0m , in the meantime , repeatedly calls upon [32m{the MJIB}[0m to stop doing work not related to national security or crime prevention , and demands that [32m{they}[0m maintain strict political neutrality . 
(5) [34m{Investigators}[0m complain that [34m{they}[0m do n't know who to listen to , and it is difficult for [34m{them}[0m to concentrate on [34m{their}[0m work and play [34m{their}[0m proper role in the justice system . 
(6) The intelligence apparatus is supposedly subject to supervision by the legislature , which wields budgetary authority over these agencies and has the power to review internal administrative documents that do not contain classified information . 
(7) In reality , however , [36m{intelligence operations}[0m are extremely secretive , and legislators can do little to hold [36m{them}[0m in check . 
(8) [1m[31m{Taiwan}[0m now faces two very pressing tasks related to [1m[31m{its}[0m intelligence operations . 
(9) The jurisdiction of [32m{the MJIB}[0m , for one thing , must be clarified . 
(10) And secondly , [1m[31m{our}[0m domestic intelligence activities must be subject to effective oversight so that [31m{no government of any stripe}[0m will ever again engage in repression of [31m{its}[0m political opponents .
