(0) At [1m[34m{the Supreme Court}[0m tonight -- important questions about medical testing and privacy rights of individuals . 
(1) When can [1m[32m{doctors}[0m tell police [1m[32m{they}[0m 've discovered evidence [1m[32m{their}[0m patients are committing crimes ? 
(2) Here 's [3m[31m{NBC 's}[0m Pete Williams . 
(3) It 's [33m{a case that pits a woman 's medical privacy against the state 's desire to protect children}[0m . 
(4) Faced with an epidemic of cocaine use by [3m[34m{pregnant mothers who were potentially putting their babies at risk}[0m , the medical staff at [1m[31m{this Charleston , South Carolina , hospital}[0m came up with [1m[33m{a novel idea -- decide which of the pregnant where things went wrong}[0m . 
(5) We need doctors to act like doctors , not doctors to act like police . 
(6) But [34m{the state}[0m defends [1m[33m{it}[0m as a way to get mothers off drugs , reducing the risk of having unhealthy babies . 
(7) I went over and looked at these babies when [33m{this case}[0m started . 
(8) We 're talking about a 3 1 / 2 - pound human being . 
(9) It would make you cry . 
(10) The question for [36m{the court}[0m -- When can doctors tip off police ? 
(11) Justice Scalia said -- [3m[32m{Doctors}[0m routinely report when [3m[32m{they}[0m find gunshot wounds , Why not when [3m[32m{they}[0m find proof of drug use ? but Justice Ginsburg asked -- How can [1m[31m{the hospital}[0m say [1m[31m{it}[0m 's protecting unborn children by arresting [32m{women}[0m after [32m{they}[0m give birth ? 
(12) [35m{Many of the nation 's big medical groups}[0m oppose [1m[33m{the South Carolina policy}[0m . 
(13) [35m{They}[0m say the threat of arrest will frighten [1m[36m{more women}[0m away from pregnancy care , further endangering [1m[36m{their}[0m babies . 
(14) If [36m{the justices}[0m uphold [1m[33m{the South Carolina policy}[0m , [3m[35m{many of the nation 's doctors}[0m fear [3m[35m{they}[0m 'll be called on to report more crimes , eroding the trust between [3m[35m{them}[0m and [3m[35m{their}[0m patients . 
(15) [1m[35m{Pete Williams}[0m , [3m[31m{NBC News}[0m , at [1m[34m{the Supreme Court}[0m .
