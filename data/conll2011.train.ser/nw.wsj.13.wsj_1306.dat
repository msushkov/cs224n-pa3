(0) [4m[32m{Tandy Corp.}[0m said [4m[32m{it}[0m wo n't join [4m[31m{U.S. Memories , the group that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips}[0m . 
(1) [4m[32m{Tandy 's}[0m decision is a second setback for [4m[31m{U.S. Memories}[0m . 
(2) Last month , [32m{Apple Computer Inc.}[0m said that [32m{it}[0m would n't invest in [4m[31m{the group}[0m . 
(3) [32m{Apple}[0m said that [32m{its}[0m money would be better spent in areas such as research and development . 
(4) [4m[31m{U.S. Memories}[0m is seeking major investors to back [4m[31m{its}[0m attempt to crack the $ 10 billion market for [35m{dynamic random access memory chips}[0m , a market dominated by the Japanese . 
(5) [35m{Those chips}[0m were in [36m{dire shortage}[0m last year , hurting many U.S. computer companies that could n't get sufficient Japanese - supplied chips . 
(6) [4m[32m{Tandy}[0m said [4m[32m{its}[0m experience during [36m{the shortage}[0m did n't merit the $ 5 million to $ 50 million investment [4m[31m{U.S. Memories}[0m is seeking from each investor . 
(7) `` At this time , [4m[32m{we}[0m [4m[35m{elected}[0m not to get involved because [4m[32m{we}[0m have been able to satisfy [4m[32m{our}[0m need -LCB- for DRAMs -RCB- from the market as a rule , '' said Ed Juge , [4m[32m{Tandy 's}[0m director of market planning . 
(8) [31m{Sanford Kane , U.S. Memories president ,}[0m said [4m[35m{the decision}[0m was `` disappointing , '' but does n't presage [4m[31m{U.S. Memories '}[0m failure . 
(9) `` [31m{I}[0m would like to have had [4m[32m{them}[0m , '' [31m{he}[0m said . 
(10) But `` [4m[32m{they}[0m were n't on [31m{my}[0m list of companies who were critical to be a part of [4m[31m{it}[0m . '' 
(11) [31m{Mr. Kane}[0m became president and chief executive officer of [4m[31m{U.S. Memories}[0m last June , when [4m[31m{the group}[0m was formed by seven electronics companies : Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. ; Hewlett - Packard Co. ; Intel Corp. ; International Business Machines Corp. ; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp . 
(12) [31m{Mr. Kane}[0m said [31m{he}[0m expects [4m[33m{two or three major corporations}[0m to announce [4m[33m{their}[0m participation in [4m[31m{U.S. Memories}[0m soon after [4m[31m{the group}[0m finishes a business plan , probably late this week . 
(13) [4m[31m{U.S. Memories}[0m needs a catalyst , [31m{he}[0m said , to inspire others to join . 
(14) But so far , most potential participants have n't decided . 
(15) [34m{Sun Microsystems Inc.}[0m said [34m{it}[0m 's still actively evaluating [4m[31m{U.S. Memories}[0m and plans to meet with [4m[31m{U.S. Memories}[0m representatives later this week . 
(16) [4m[36m{American Telephone & Telegraph Co.}[0m said [4m[36m{it}[0m was waiting to see [4m[31m{U.S. Memories '}[0m business plan . 
(17) [4m[34m{Personal - computer maker AST Research Inc.}[0m said [4m[34m{it}[0m is still studying the situation . 
(18) A [33m{Compaq Computer Corp.}[0m spokeswoman said that [33m{the company}[0m has n't made a decision yet , although `` it is n't under active consideration .
