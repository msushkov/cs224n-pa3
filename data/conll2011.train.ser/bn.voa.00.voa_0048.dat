(0) Thank you and Goodday . 
(1) More deadly violence has erupted in the West Bank as [36m{Israel 's}[0m Prime Minister Ehud Barak failed to form a government of national unity . 
(2) As night fell [1m[32m{Monday}[0m , in the town of Hebron , one Palestinian man was shot dead in an exchange of fire between Palestinian militiamen and Israeli soldiers . 
(3) There were also gun battles near Jerusalem . 
(4) About 130 people have been killed in more than three weeks of violence , almost all Palestinians . 
(5) [1m[32m{Monday}[0m , [34m{Mr. Barak}[0m met with [36m{Israel 's}[0m right wing [32m{Likud Party}[0m leader Ariel Sharon , to form an emergency unity government to deal with the crisis , but [32m{Likud}[0m says the two failed to agree on terms . 
(6) [31m{Middle East}[0m expert Mark Gulpan , of Tufts University , says [36m{Israel 's}[0m fragile coalition politics may stand in the way . 
(7) Well , [4m[36m{they}[0m have made deals with [32m{Likud}[0m before and [32m{Likud}[0m is not completely [4m[33m{just Sharon}[0m , there are moderates within [32m{Likud}[0m . 
(8) So , [33m{I}[0m think [4m[36m{they}[0m are capable of [1m[31m{making}[0m deals with [32m{them}[0m and [1m[31m{that}[0m 's not really [4m[35m{the problem}[0m . 
(9) [4m[35m{The problem}[0m is that the coalition may prevent any possibility of creating a real agreement . 
(10) [35m{Palestinians}[0m have said [35m{they}[0m will not work with [4m[33m{Mr. Sharon}[0m , and here in US , [4m[34m{Clinton}[0m administration spokesman Jake Sewart says [4m[34m{the President}[0m is still hard at work trying to find a solution for the [31m{Middle East}[0m crisis . 
(11) [4m[34m{He}[0m has continued to consult with [1m[33m{both parties}[0m and with leaders in the that we can to try to get [1m[33m{the parties}[0m to agree on and to move forward on the agreement we reached in Egypt .
