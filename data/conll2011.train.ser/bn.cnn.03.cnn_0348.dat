(0) As we told you at the top of this newscast , [3m[32m{an Oklahoma judge}[0m has ruled that [1m[36m{Terry Nichols}[0m will indeed stand trial in that state court on 160 counts of first - degree murder . 
(1) [1m[36m{The Oklahoma City bombing conspirator}[0m is already serving a life term in federal prison . 
(2) State proceedings could bring the death penalty if [1m[36m{Nichols}[0m is convicted . 
(3) A trial date was not immediately set by [3m[32m{the judge whose decision came as prosecutors were still presenting evidence}[0m . 
(4) [3m[35m{A Texas woman}[0m is in jail this morning [4m[32m{accused}[0m of killing [3m[35m{her}[0m two sons and severely beating another the day before Mother 's Day . 
(5) Yesterday [3m[35m{a silent Dee Ana Laney}[0m waited as [3m[31m{the judge}[0m read [4m[32m{the charges against her , capital murder and aggravated assault}[0m . 
(6) [3m[31m{One of the first people to arrive at the crime scene , Judge James Marin .}[0m 
(7) Thanks very much . 
(8) Why were [3m[31m{you}[0m there so quickly ? 
(9) [3m[31m{I}[0m was n't really there that quickly . 
(10) [3m[31m{I}[0m actually responded a few hours after the Sheriff 's Department did . 
(11) The reason [3m[31m{you}[0m went was ? 
(12) Well , being the justice of the peace [3m[34m{we}[0m are the ones that hold the inquest on the death and they were required to call [3m[34m{us}[0m to [3m[33m{the scene}[0m . 
(13) What did [3m[31m{you}[0m see when [3m[31m{you}[0m got there ? 
(14) Well , to be honest with you , [3m[31m{I}[0m saw [1m[35m{a pretty gruesome sight}[0m and [3m[31m{I}[0m think [1m[35m{it}[0m 's been talked about quite a bit the last few days and if [4m[31m{anybody}[0m did n't have to be there to see [1m[35m{it}[0m , [4m[31m{they}[0m were lucky not to have to be there . 
(15) [1m[35m{It}[0m was a horrific sight , [3m[31m{you}[0m do n't have to go into details , obviously , we can only imagine how bad [1m[35m{it}[0m might have been . 
(16) [1m[35m{It}[0m probably was , indeed , based on [3m[31m{your}[0m eyewitness accounts . 
(17) What happened ? 
(18) [3m[36m{They}[0m were collecting evidence as [3m[31m{you}[0m were there , [3m[36m{the law enforcement authorities}[0m ? 
(19) [3m[36m{They}[0m had been collecting [3m[36m{their}[0m evidence and , of course , when [3m[31m{I}[0m got there [3m[36m{they}[0m showed [3m[31m{me}[0m [3m[33m{the location}[0m and , of course , then having to do --
