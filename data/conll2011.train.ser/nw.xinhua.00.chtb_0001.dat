(0) [31m{The development of Shanghai 's Pudong}[0m is in step with the establishment of [4m[34m{its}[0m legal system 
(1) Xinhua News Agency , [4m[33m{Shanghai}[0m , February 10 , by wire -LRB- reporters Jinhu Xie and Chijian Zhang -RRB- 
(2) In recent years [4m[34m{Shanghai 's Pudong}[0m has promulgated and implemented 71 regulatory documents relating to areas such as economics , trade , construction , planning , science and technology , culture and education , etc. , ensuring the orderly advancement of [4m[34m{Pudong 's}[0m development . 
(3) [4m[34m{Pudong 's}[0m development and opening up is a century - spanning undertaking for vigorously promoting [4m[33m{Shanghai}[0m and constructing a modern economic , trade , and financial center . 
(4) Because of [32m{this}[0m , new situations and new questions that have not been encountered before are [4m[35m{emerging}[0m in great numbers . 
(5) In response to [4m[35m{this}[0m , [4m[34m{Pudong}[0m is not simply adopting an approach of " work for a short time and then draw up laws and regulations only after waiting until experience has been accumulated . " 
(6) Instead , [4m[34m{Pudong}[0m is taking advantage of the lessons from experience of developed countries and special regions such as Shenzhen by hiring appropriate domestic and foreign specialists and scholars , by actively and promptly formulating and issuing regulatory documents , and by ensuring that [4m[36m{these economic activities}[0m are incorporated into the sphere of influence of [33m{the legal system}[0m as soon as [4m[36m{they}[0m appear . 
(7) Precisely because as soon as [3m[36m{it}[0m opened [3m[36m{it}[0m was relatively standardized , [3m[36m{China 's first drug purchase service center for medical treatment institutions , which came into being at the beginning of last year in the Pudong new region}[0m , in operating up to now , has concluded transactions for drugs of over 100 million yuan and has n't had one case of kickback . 
(8) Construction is a principal economic activity in developing [4m[34m{Pudong}[0m . 
(9) These years there have been several hundred construction companies and over four thousand construction sites that have spread out all over this stretch of hot turf . 
(10) In order to standardize construction procedures and to guard against the emergence of disorderly phenomena , [4m[34m{the new region 's}[0m management committee promptly announced [34m{a series of documents for standardizing the construction market in accordance with the relevant national regulations and the regulations of Shanghai Municipality}[0m , while accommodating the realities of [4m[34m{Pudong 's}[0m development . 
(11) [34m{The documents}[0m include : management methods for bidding on construction projects ; a certain number of regulations for demolition and removal work ; implementation methods for fixing construction that violated regulations ; construction suggestions for communications installations and cable setups ; provisional methods for environmental management at construction work sites ; etc . 
(12) Essentially [34m{they}[0m are worked out to the point where every single link has clearly defined and specific regulations . 
(13) When a construction company enters [4m[34m{the region}[0m , first the appropriate bureau delivers [34m{these regulatory documents}[0m , and afterwards there is a specialized contingent that carries out a supervisory inspection . 
(14) In spite of the fact that of [34m{the regulatory documents that the Pudong new region has formulated}[0m , some are relatively " crude " and some are still [4m[31m{only provisional regulations awaiting step - by - step completion as they are put into practice}[0m , nevertheless , this kind of approach , with [33m{the legal system}[0m tightly coupled with economic and social activities , has received positive comments from [4m[32m{domestic and foreign investors}[0m . 
(15) [4m[32m{They}[0m believe that in coming to [4m[34m{the Pudong new region}[0m to invest there is methodicalness and attention to rules in the handling of business , and interests can receive safeguards .
