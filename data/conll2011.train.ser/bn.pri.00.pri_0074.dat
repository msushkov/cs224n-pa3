(0) [4m[34m{This}[0m is The World , [1m[31m{I}[0m am Lisa Mullins . 
(1) History was made in [4m[35m{mexico}[0m [1m[34m{today}[0m when [3m[34m{Vicente Fox}[0m was [31m{sworn}[0m in as President . 
(2) [31m{This}[0m was no ordinary inauguration . 
(3) [31m{It}[0m marked the first peaceful transfer of power to the opposition in [4m[35m{Mexico 's}[0m history . 
(4) [34m{Few Mexicans}[0m can remember when [34m{their}[0m President was not a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , whose 71 years in power ended this afternoon . 
(5) [3m[34m{Fox , a conservative ,}[0m leads the National Action Party . 
(6) [4m[34m{The World 's}[0m Frank Contraris is in [3m[35m{Mexico City}[0m . 
(7) [3m[33m{Frank}[0m , [31m{the swearing in ceremony}[0m is now over . 
(8) What did [3m[34m{President Fox}[0m have to say ? 
(9) [3m[34m{President Vicente Fox}[0m touched on the biggest , most troubling issues facing Mexicans today . 
(10) [3m[34m{He}[0m spoke about what [3m[34m{he}[0m can do to solve the poverty that has driven [1m[36m{so many hundreds of thousands of people}[0m north , into [4m[32m{the United States}[0m seeking work . 
(11) [3m[34m{He}[0m wants to try to find a way to keep [1m[36m{them}[0m home , and one of the other things that [3m[34m{he}[0m touched on , [1m[31m{Lisa}[0m , [3m[34m{he}[0m says that [4m[35m{Mexico}[0m never again will return to [1m[35m{repressive means to try to control the people}[0m . 
(12) [3m[34m{My}[0m government will not tolerate that [1m[35m{these methods of the past}[0m be used again . 
(13) [1m[32m{We}[0m will not use the security forces of [4m[35m{our country}[0m to silence critics or neutralize opponents . 
(14) [1m[35m{Repression}[0m will never again be a way to resolve political disputes . 
(15) And one of the other main subjects [3m[34m{he}[0m touched on [1m[34m{today}[0m , [1m[31m{Lisa}[0m , was [3m[31m{the conflicted southern state of Chiapas}[0m . 
(16) [3m[34m{Fox}[0m says that [3m[34m{his}[0m first presidential act will be to send up a proposal to the congress to immediately begin to bring a process of peace back into [3m[31m{Chiapas State}[0m and [4m[36m{that}[0m 's something that people really did n't expect to happen so quickly here . 
(17) All of these issues actually are issues that [4m[32m{the United States}[0m has been watching very carefully , and [3m[32m{US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright}[0m is there in [3m[35m{mexico city}[0m for [31m{the inaugural}[0m . 
(18) [3m[32m{She}[0m is meeting with [4m[35m{Mexico 's}[0m new Foreign Minister , who is [36m{the writer and academic Jorge Castaneda}[0m . 
(19) [36m{He}[0m , in fact , lived in New York for a number of years . 
(20) What has [3m[34m{the new President Fox}[0m said so far about relations with [4m[32m{the United States}[0m ? 
(21) [3m[34m{Fox}[0m says that [4m[35m{Mexico 's}[0m relations with [4m[32m{the US}[0m are strong , but [3m[34m{he}[0m sees opportunities . 
(22) [3m[34m{He}[0m still is convinced that [3m[34m{he}[0m can talk to [4m[32m{the United States government}[0m into opening up [4m[32m{its}[0m borders and eventually letting in [4m[33m{more Mexican 's}[0m under the Free Trade Agreement . 
(23) [4m[33m{More Mexicans , who would come in to the country legally .}[0m 
(24) [3m[34m{Fox}[0m believes that in 20 or 30 years [4m[32m{the United States}[0m , Canada and all of Latin America should be [1m[33m{one unified market}[0m , much in a way that the European Community is unified , and so [3m[34m{Fox}[0m is going to use [3m[34m{his}[0m marketing sensibility to try to convince the American people that [1m[33m{this}[0m is the way to go . 
(25) Remember , [3m[34m{Fox}[0m comes from a strong marketing background . 
(26) [3m[34m{He}[0m was the executive of Coca - Cola from [4m[35m{Mexico}[0m , so [3m[34m{he}[0m understands how these things work . 
(27) [1m[31m{I}[0m wonder if [3m[33m{you}[0m can tell us a little bit about something that [3m[36m{Cuban President Fidel Castro , who is also there today ,}[0m said earlier in the week . 
(28) [3m[36m{He}[0m [4m[31m{said}[0m that the previous President Ernesto Zedillo was too much of a servant to [4m[32m{the United States}[0m . 
(29) Is that issue something that [3m[34m{Fox}[0m is likely to pay attention to ? 
(30) Is [4m[31m{that}[0m kind of a warning for [3m[34m{Fox}[0m at all ? 
(31) [4m[31m{That}[0m 's definitely a message to [3m[34m{Vicente Fox}[0m from [3m[36m{Fidel Castro}[0m and [3m[33m{I}[0m am sure that other Latin American presidents feel the same way , but [3m[34m{Fox}[0m really has already shown very early on that [3m[34m{he}[0m is going to try to be an unusual kind of leader with [4m[32m{the United States}[0m , [3m[34m{he}[0m is not going to kowtow to [4m[32m{Washington}[0m . 
(32) In fact , just weeks after [3m[34m{he}[0m was elected [3m[34m{he}[0m showed [4m[32m{Washington}[0m that [3m[34m{he}[0m has [3m[34m{his}[0m own initiatives and some of [35m{them}[0m might even frighten leaders in our national capital there , so [3m[33m{I}[0m think you can expect [3m[34m{Fox}[0m to continue the economic policies that [4m[35m{Mexico}[0m has been criticized for , that is following the economic lead of [4m[32m{the United States}[0m , but at the same time [3m[34m{he}[0m will come up with concrete policies for dealing with immigrants ' rights and other such matters that we have never really seen before . 
(33) [4m[34m{The World 's}[0m Frank Contraris in [3m[35m{Mexico City}[0m . 
(34) [3m[33m{Frank Contraris}[0m , thank [3m[33m{you}[0m again . 
(35) Thank [1m[31m{you}[0m , [1m[31m{Lisa}[0m .
