(0) Most Americans do n't yet have a really good picture of [36m{Laura Bush}[0m . 
(1) To discuss [36m{the new first lady}[0m , [4m[33m{we}[0m are rejoined by [4m[33m{our}[0m panel . 
(2) [1m[36m{David}[0m , why do n't [1m[36m{you}[0m take a whack at this . 
(3) Have [1m[36m{you}[0m ever met [36m{her}[0m ? 
(4) No , [1m[36m{I}[0m have n't . 
(5) [1m[36m{I}[0m think it is clear , though , from watching [36m{her}[0m throughout the past year and a half [36m{she}[0m is more of the traditional mold of predecessors of [4m[32m{Hillary Clinton}[0m than like [4m[32m{Hillary Clinton}[0m . 
(6) [36m{She}[0m is not going to try to break the mold like [4m[32m{Mrs. Clinton}[0m did by [1m[35m{taking}[0m an active role in policy making . 
(7) A lot of Americans were uncomfortable with [1m[35m{that}[0m and [1m[36m{I}[0m think ended up being a mistake . 
(8) [1m[34m{Joyce}[0m , it looks like [1m[34m{you}[0m want to say something . 
(9) [1m[34m{I}[0m quibble with the idea [36m{she}[0m is of another generation . 
(10) [4m[36m{Not every wife}[0m necessarily wants to be in politics just because [4m[36m{her}[0m husband is in politics . 
(11) That does n't make [36m{her}[0m a throwback . 
(12) , [1m[34m{I}[0m believe it is probably true , and [4m[32m{Hillary}[0m also learned in time that it is n't a good idea for the first lady to become too identified with specific policy initiates , at least publicly . 
(13) [1m[34m{I}[0m think [4m[32m{she herself}[0m pulled back on that . 
(14) Well , [32m{Deborah}[0m , let's [4m[31m{us}[0m pay proper respect . 
(15) [36m{She}[0m is a teacher and cares about [1m[33m{something tremendously important to this country , literacy}[0m . 
(16) Exactly . 
(17) [36m{She}[0m has worked hard on [1m[33m{this issue}[0m . 
(18) [36m{She}[0m will tackle [1m[33m{the issue}[0m the same way [31m{Barbara Bush}[0m did , encouraging reading . 
(19) [32m{I}[0m 'm sure [36m{she}[0m will have programs and initiatives . 
(20) [4m[32m{Hillary Clinton}[0m did a lot of things too . 
(21) [4m[32m{She}[0m is out with another book , Entertaining at the White House and Redecorating the White House . 
(22) Doing what we think of as more traditional first lady things can be very , very effective . 
(23) [32m{Deborah}[0m , [32m{you}[0m remember that [4m[32m{Mrs. Clinton}[0m chafed at [1m[31m{the idea of being in the traditional role}[0m . 
(24) [4m[32m{She}[0m was not at all happy about [1m[31m{it}[0m . 
(25) In the first campaign [4m[32m{she}[0m talked about [4m[35m{having}[0m to bake cookies . 
(26) [4m[32m{She}[0m [35m{was}[0m n't pleased with [4m[35m{that}[0m . 
(27) [35m{That}[0m is right . 
(28) [1m[34m{Joyce}[0m makes a good point , too . 
(29) After health care reform failed , [4m[32m{he}[0m changed [4m[32m{her}[0m steages a bit . 
(30) [4m[32m{She}[0m pulled back . 
(31) [4m[32m{She}[0m began doing more traditional things in public , whereas in private [4m[32m{she}[0m did still work on the causes [4m[32m{she}[0m cared about , [4m[32m{she}[0m advocated and lobbied in a quiet , behind the scenes way . 
(32) [4m[32m{She}[0m did n't make a big deal out of being a co-president anymore . 
(33) That is exactly my point , Joe . 
(34) [4m[32m{Mrs. Clinton}[0m wants to [1m[32m{deal}[0m with policy . 
(35) [4m[32m{She}[0m loves [1m[32m{that}[0m and is steeped in [1m[32m{it}[0m . 
(36) Clearly [36m{Mrs. Bush}[0m does n't want to go down that road . 
(37) It depends . 
(38) [33m{Literacy}[0m is a big problem in [4m[34m{this country}[0m . 
(39) Nothing that [31m{Barbara Bush}[0m did or said , with due respect , addressed [33m{it}[0m in an important way . 
(40) It was more of a show . 
(41) What needs to be done about literacy is to spend a lot of money , which President - elect Bush proposed . 
(42) [34m{That}[0m was a large spending program , a $ 5 billion literacy program . 
(43) [36m{Laura Bush}[0m could be a big help with [34m{that}[0m , not like [4m[32m{Hillary Clinton with health care}[0m , but a symbol with teachers , librarians , people who care about reading and believe every American should be able to read and put clout behind [34m{it}[0m . 
(44) In that way [36m{she}[0m could be a great asset . 
(45) [34m{It}[0m is a policy that is very hard to disagree with . 
(46) [36m{She}[0m could be the symbol of really doing something . 
(47) Let us hope so . 
(48) Thank [4m[31m{you}[0m for talking to [4m[33m{us}[0m .
