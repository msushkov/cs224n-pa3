(0) [1m[32m{Ecuador 's}[0m economy is showing [4m[32m{strong improvement}[0m . 
(1) [1m[32m{Ecuador 's}[0m Central Bank reports a healthy economic recovery with growth in the second trimester of 2.4 percent . 
(2) [4m[32m{This}[0m follows [1m[32m{the country 's}[0m bold move to [3m[32m{dollarize}[0m [32m{the economy}[0m . 
(3) [36m{VOA 's}[0m Greg Flankis reports from [1m[35m{Quito}[0m , while [1m[36m{the plan}[0m is working , economists still see some problems ahead . 
(4) Driving through the narrow streets of downtown Quito , [4m[33m{taxi driver Abdun Mesios}[0m has nothing but praise for [3m[32m{the dollarization of his country 's economy}[0m . 
(5) [4m[33m{He}[0m says things are more stable now and that [3m[33m{the transition from the former currency known as the sucre}[0m has not been difficult . 
(6) [4m[33m{He}[0m says that [3m[31m{people who work with the public}[0m are having to make change everyday and so [3m[31m{they}[0m learned fast how to work with the money from [3m[36m{the United States}[0m . 
(7) When [3m[33m{the six month transition}[0m ended last month and all transactions in [1m[32m{Ecuador}[0m moved to [3m[35m{the dollar system}[0m , [4m[34m{many merchants}[0m found [4m[34m{they}[0m were short of change . 
(8) [35m{Jacqueline , who works in a small shop near Quito 's cathedral ,}[0m says [1m[34m{lack of coins}[0m is the biggest problem . 
(9) [35m{She}[0m says [1m[34m{it}[0m happens all the time and that [35m{she}[0m loses money because [1m[33m{they}[0m do n't have enough coins to make change . 
(10) [1m[32m{The Ecuadorian government}[0m has minted coins that resemble US coins in an effort to provide more small change for merchants , but it has taken some time to reach all areas , in small rural communities in the countryside , because not enough dollars have made it into circulation there , but [1m[32m{the government}[0m and [4m[31m{President Gustavo Nobora}[0m considers these to be short - term problems and views [3m[32m{the overall policy}[0m as a grand success . 
(11) Most people in the financial community agree . 
(12) [1m[31m{Economist Maria Delapasvela , who works with the magazine Rabista Hastion}[0m says [3m[32m{adopting}[0m [3m[35m{the US dollar}[0m has put an end to [1m[32m{Ecuador 's}[0m crisis atmosphere characterized by runs on banks and other disruptions . 
(13) [1m[31m{She}[0m says [33m{the immediate effect of the dollarization}[0m has been the stabilization of [32m{the economy}[0m . 
(14) [1m[31m{She}[0m says 1998 and 1999 were years in which [1m[32m{Ecuador}[0m suffered the worst economic crisis in [1m[32m{its}[0m history . 
(15) During that time , [1m[31m{she}[0m notes , [4m[35m{the sucre}[0m went from just over 6,000 to the dollar to almost 25,000 to the dollar . 
(16) [1m[31m{Maria Delapasvela}[0m says conducting business in [1m[32m{Ecuador}[0m had become a real challenge as [34m{factory and storeowners}[0m needed to keep an eye on currency fluctuation almost on an hourly basis in order to plan [34m{their}[0m purchases and sales . 
(17) [1m[31m{She}[0m says inflation is now on the decline and bank deposits are increasing . 
(18) [3m[33m{The transition to dollars}[0m was eased somewhat by a sharp increase in oil prices in the past year , which allowed [1m[32m{oil - producing Ecuador}[0m to buy plenty of dollars on the international market , but [1m[31m{Maria Delapasvela}[0m says now is the time to start thinking about what happens when the situation changes . 
(19) [1m[31m{She}[0m asks what will happen when oil prices go back down and [1m[32m{the country}[0m can no longer bring in sufficient dollars to sustain [1m[32m{its}[0m economy . 
(20) [1m[31m{The Ecuadorian economist}[0m says now is the time for [1m[32m{the government}[0m to implement fiscal reforms and to stimulate competitiveness and diversification in [32m{the economy}[0m . 
(21) [1m[31m{She}[0m says [1m[32m{the Nobora government}[0m is rightfully proud of [33m{the immediate short - term effects of its dollarization policy}[0m , but that [1m[32m{it}[0m needs to concentrate on the medium and long - term outlook . 
(22) [1m[31m{She}[0m says , unless [1m[32m{the government}[0m develops a plan soon to address [1m[32m{Ecuador 's}[0m fundamental structural problems , [3m[32m{the use of the US dollar as a medium of exchange}[0m will not be enough to keep [1m[32m{the country 's}[0m economy healthy . 
(23) [1m[36m{The experiment in Ecuador}[0m is being watched closely not only by [3m[36m{the United States , which receives a certain benefit from the increased demand for dollars}[0m , but by other nations in the region . 
(24) [4m[36m{The concept of dollarization}[0m has been discussed from Argentina to Mexico in the past few years . 
(25) Some US economists , in fact , had viewed [1m[32m{Ecuador}[0m as a poor place to test the [4m[36m{idea}[0m since [1m[32m{its}[0m economy is still burdened by heavy external debt and [1m[32m{its}[0m export sector is relatively undeveloped . 
(26) Still , as one observer puts it , officials in some nations may conclude that if [3m[34m{dollarization}[0m can work here in [1m[32m{Ecuador}[0m , [3m[34m{it}[0m can work anywhere . 
(27) [31m{Greg Flykus}[0m , [36m{VOA News}[0m , [1m[35m{Quito , Ecuador}[0m .
