(0) This letter was inspired by [3m[36m{David Asman 's}[0m Sept. 25 editorial - page article about [1m[31m{Fidel Castro}[0m , `` Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking . '' 
(1) [3m[35m{I}[0m 've organized [3m[32m{a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between Cuban and American artists}[0m . 
(2) In any matters between [3m[34m{us}[0m and the Cubans there can be no simplicity , consequently [3m[35m{I}[0m 've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists , but also with [35m{Cuban bureaucrats}[0m and [35m{their}[0m counterparts in [3m[34m{our own government}[0m . 
(3) Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , [3m[32m{these projects}[0m all [36m{remain}[0m , in [3m[35m{my}[0m mind , valuable and well worth the effort . 
(4) There is [34m{a simple reason for this : the Cuban people}[0m . 
(5) Let [3m[35m{me}[0m immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions [34m{that}[0m may intimate . 
(6) [1m[35m{Those `` people '' to whom I refer}[0m are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; [1m[35m{they}[0m are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc . 
(7) In fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara 's famous linkages of art , idealism and revolution seem modest . 
(8) It is on behalf of [1m[35m{these people}[0m , and out of [3m[35m{my}[0m real respect for [1m[35m{them}[0m , that [3m[35m{I}[0m am responding to [3m[36m{Mr. Asman 's}[0m opinions of [1m[35m{their}[0m country . 
(9) [3m[31m{The Ochoa trial in July , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution ,}[0m was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of [1m[32m{Cuba}[0m . 
(10) However , unacceptable though [3m[31m{those occurrences}[0m may have been , [3m[31m{they}[0m still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth . 
(11) [3m[36m{Mr. Asman}[0m should make distinctions among [1m[33m{Fidel , the army and the Cuban people}[0m . 
(12) [1m[33m{They}[0m are not interchangeable , since [1m[33m{they}[0m are motivated to act based on [1m[33m{their}[0m own circumstances . 
(13) It is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the people -LRB- as [3m[34m{we}[0m well know -RRB- , and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of [1m[31m{Fidel}[0m and [1m[36m{the military}[0m and [1m[32m{the state bureaucracy}[0m . 
(14) [3m[36m{Mr. Asman}[0m is also annoyed that [1m[31m{Mr. Castro}[0m has resisted [3m[33m{collaboration with U.S. officials}[0m , even though by [3m[36m{his}[0m own account [3m[33m{that collaboration}[0m has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the Cuban regime , such as facilitating defections . 
(15) [3m[35m{I}[0m think it 's a little disingenuous to be surprised that [1m[31m{Fidel}[0m does n't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of [1m[32m{the Cuban government}[0m over [1m[32m{its}[0m own territory . 
(16) [3m[34m{We}[0m badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom . 
(17) Without this basic level of attention to reality , [3m[34m{our}[0m policies on [1m[32m{Cuba}[0m will continue to be as counterproductive as [1m[34m{they}[0m have for 30 years . 
(18) From [3m[35m{my}[0m own point of view , given the qualities of humanity , creativity and warm spirit in which [1m[32m{the Cuban people}[0m excel , [3m[34m{we}[0m deny [3m[34m{ourselves}[0m access to things [3m[34m{we}[0m hold dear , and which seem to run in such short supply these days . 
(19) There is no rational justification for such behavior . 
(20) [3m[35m{Rachel Weiss Brookline , Mass .}[0m
