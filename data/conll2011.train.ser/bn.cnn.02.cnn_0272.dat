(0) Looking at like pictures of [1m[33m{Air Force One now on the ground at a Royal Air Force base outside of Belfast , Northern Ireland , it 's called Aldergrove , just outside Belfast}[0m . 
(1) [35m{The President of the United States}[0m coming for a brief two - day summit with [3m[31m{the British Prime Minister Tony Blair}[0m . 
(2) [33m{They}[0m 'll be talking about a postwar Iraq among other important subjects . 
(3) [33m{They}[0m 'll also have an opportunity to review the so - called road map for Israeli / Palestinian peace negotiations to get off the ground . 
(4) [33m{They}[0m also want to review what the status is of [1m[36m{Northern Ireland}[0m right now as that peace process seems to be taking hold . 
(5) Been relatively quiet in [1m[36m{Northern Ireland}[0m over the past few years . 
(6) This is the third time in as many weeks that [33m{President Bush and Prime Minister Blair}[0m will be sitting down to review station , war strategy , as [33m{they}[0m go forward together , go forward as close allies in trying to help put together [32m{a new Iraq}[0m . 
(7) There are some significant differences in [33m{their}[0m strategy , including what role precisely the United Nations should have in determining [1m[34m{the future of Iraq}[0m . 
(8) [33m{They}[0m 'll try to thrash all of that out . 
(9) You 're looking at [1m[31m{the picture of Air Force One taxiing in on the tarmac , getting ready for the President}[0m . 
(10) As [1m[35m{we}[0m watched [1m[31m{this picture of the Air Force One getting into this airport}[0m [3m[34m{I}[0m want to bring in [3m[33m{our military analyst General Dan Crisman to go over what is happening in Baghdad}[0m . 
(11) Seems pretty far away from [34m{Belfast}[0m right now , [3m[33m{General}[0m , but decisions that [33m{these two leaders}[0m make could have a significant impact on [1m[34m{the future of Iraq}[0m . 
(12) First of all , [3m[33m{General}[0m , [1m[35m{we}[0m 'll keep this [1m[31m{picture}[0m up of [1m[33m{Air Force One}[0m , talk about what [3m[33m{you}[0m sense is happening on the streets of [4m[31m{Baghdad}[0m right now . 
(13) [3m[34m{Wolf}[0m , it 's clearly [4m[34m{the final phase , the endgame which is unfolding right now}[0m . 
(14) [3m[33m{I}[0m think [4m[34m{it}[0m 's very significant not only in [4m[31m{Baghdad}[0m but [4m[33m{Basra itself}[0m . 
(15) You have [4m[35m{coalition forces there in some strength}[0m . 
(16) Apparently three battalians of the U.S. 3rd Division in [4m[31m{Baghdad}[0m [1m[32m{three coalition assets , three huge battle groups in Basra itself which the U.K. has there}[0m . 
(17) What [4m[35m{they}[0m 've developed here , [3m[34m{Wolf}[0m , over the last several weeks is very clear and increasingly clear intelligence as to what [4m[32m{the final remnants of the regime leadership}[0m are in terms of where [4m[32m{they}[0m are embedded in [31m{the cities}[0m . 
(18) What [4m[35m{they}[0m 're doing is going in now , very carefully , obviously some symbolic raids against palaces , but the more important presence is to go after what intelligence delivers and that 's where [4m[32m{these key leaders}[0m are located . 
(19) [4m[32m{They}[0m 're going to be defended fanatically but intelligence is so crucial from aerial platforms and special ops personnel to give [1m[32m{the three assets the intel which they need to close with and eliminate final remnants of the regime in those citys}[0m . 
(20) This is a very important final phase here , [3m[34m{Wolf}[0m , and it looks like the closure is coming here now more rapidly than we anticipated . 
(21) As [1m[35m{we}[0m continue to watch [1m[33m{Air Force One , now on the ground outside Belfast , Northern Ireland}[0m , [1m[35m{we}[0m 'll be watching [35m{President Bush}[0m emerge from [1m[33m{the plane}[0m momentarily . 
(22) [1m[35m{We}[0m 'll continue to have live coverage of that . 
(23) When Walter Rodgers , our embedded reporter with the 3rd Cavalry says [3m[32m{three battalions of troops}[0m are on the ground , inside [4m[31m{Baghdad itself}[0m , have taken up positions [3m[32m{they}[0m 're going to spend the night there presumably , how many soldiers are we talking about right now ? 
(24) Between 700 and 1,000 . 
(25) [3m[35m{The task forces}[0m really , [3m[34m{Wolf}[0m are probably built around [36m{the M Bradley the basic infantry fighting vehicle}[0m . 
(26) [36m{It}[0m is the equipment of choice for a task force like this to go into [4m[31m{Baghdad}[0m . 
(27) [36m{Its}[0m cannon , [36m{its}[0m ability to implace [3m[36m{troops}[0m and fire through the firing ports in [36m{that Bradley vehicle}[0m to take [3m[36m{them}[0m in under protection . 
(28) [36m{It}[0m 's a very , very important piece of equipment . 
(29) [3m[35m{These}[0m are probably mechanized heavy task forces that have overhead aerial platforms to provide direct support . 
(30) It 's significant the degradation of the Iraqi air defenses has allowed A - s , Predators , U - s , other assets to hover and loiter and provide the overhead protection to these tasks .
