(0) Now [1m[31m{Mr. Gore}[0m . 
(1) [1m[31m{He}[0m was campaigning in [1m[31m{his}[0m home state of Tennessee [35m{today}[0m . 
(2) [31m{Tennessee}[0m is not giving [31m{its}[0m favorite son a free ride . 
(3) Here is [34m{ABC 's}[0m Jim Wooten . 
(4) [31m{Not a bad place to be from}[0m , and [31m{not a bad place to come back to}[0m . 
(5) 7777 
(6) And although [1m[31m{he}[0m has n't been here in 2 1 / 2 months , [1m[31m{the Vice President}[0m 's here [35m{today}[0m -- 
(7) It 's great to be home in [31m{Tennessee}[0m . 
(8) Back where [1m[31m{he}[0m 's run and won 14 times in 24 years , but where [1m[35m{this week}[0m [1m[31m{he}[0m 's dead even or maybe even trailing [1m[33m{Governor Bush , who is n't in trouble at home , and who just happened to be in Tennessee this week , too , asking his favorite sarcastic question -- `` where exactly is home for the Vice President}[0m ? '' 
(9) [1m[31m{He}[0m may win [32m{Washington , D.C.}[0m , but [1m[31m{he}[0m is n't going to carry [31m{Tennessee}[0m ! 
(10) That has considerable resonance here . 
(11) [1m[33m{I}[0m think [1m[31m{he}[0m 's been in [32m{Washington}[0m too long . 
(12) [1m[33m{I}[0m do n't think people consider [1m[31m{him}[0m a Tennessean anymore . 
(13) Gerald Wiser voted for [1m[33m{Bush}[0m yesterday . 
(14) [31m{This}[0m is one of a few states with early voting . 
(15) You have nine people running for President . 
(16) And so did the Wrights , Michael and Carolyn , Independents , but not undecided . 
(17) The biggest negative for [1m[31m{Gore}[0m is [1m[31m{his}[0m association with Mr. Clinton . 
(18) The baggage ? 
(19) It 's not an example of [4m[36m{a prophet without honor in his own land or even here in his own hometown}[0m . 
(20) It 's just that [31m{Tennessee}[0m is a genuine two - party state and has been for a long , long time , and although [1m[31m{Gore}[0m has never lost an election here , [1m[31m{he}[0m 's never had a landslide either , and this time , little by little , [1m[31m{his}[0m once - comfortable ad has been [1m[34m{whittled}[0m down . 
(21) [1m[31m{His}[0m state campaign director insists , `` we expected [1m[34m{that}[0m . '' 
(22) You 've got a Republican governor , two Republican senators , [1m[32m{the majority of the membership of Congress are Republicans}[0m . 
(23) [1m[32m{They}[0m 'd like nothing better than for [1m[32m{them}[0m to embarrass [1m[31m{him}[0m in [1m[31m{his}[0m own home state . 
(24) So , [31m{Tennessee 's}[0m most illustrious modern political family is having to work mighty hard at [31m{home}[0m now and spend at least $ 1 million on local TV ads something [33m{they}[0m did n't plan on . 
(25) Can you come out and work hard for [1m[31m{him}[0m one more time ? 
(26) The importance of [31m{Tennessee}[0m to [1m[31m{my}[0m family goes way beyond its 11 electoral votes . 
(27) Sure , it 's a matter of pride , but in a race this narrow , 11 electoral votes ai n't hay . 
(28) [36m{Jim Wooten}[0m , [34m{ABC News}[0m , Nashville .
