(0) Tuesday 's rout of a [1m[33m{GOP}[0m congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that has n't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that , at least at the federal level , political `` ticket splitting '' has been on the rise over [4m[36m{the past half century}[0m . 
(1) In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did [31m{more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional districts}[0m choose a different party 's candidate for [1m[32m{the White House}[0m than for [1m[34m{the House of Representatives}[0m . 
(2) Now [31m{that percentage}[0m routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 % . 
(3) As we know , voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for [36m{Congress}[0m . 
(4) In every presidential election over [4m[36m{the past half century}[0m , except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy , [1m[33m{the GOP}[0m has captured a greater percentage of the major - party popular vote for president than [1m[33m{it}[0m has of congressional seats or the popular vote for [36m{Congress}[0m . 
(5) Prior to [4m[34m{1932}[0m , the pattern was nearly the opposite . 
(6) What accounts for the results of recent decades ? 
(7) [3m[36m{A simple economic theory}[0m may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth . 
(8) [3m[36m{The theory}[0m relies on [3m[32m{three assumptions}[0m : 
(9) 1 -RRB- [1m[33m{Voters}[0m can `` buy '' one of [3m[33m{two brands}[0m when [1m[33m{they}[0m select [1m[33m{their}[0m political agents -- [3m[33m{a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest}[0m . 
(10) 2 -RRB- Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues -LRB- programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and / or confers benefits on the population at large -RRB- and attending to local issues -LRB- constituency service and pork barrel -RRB- . 
(11) 3 -RRB- [33m{Republican congressional representatives}[0m , because of [33m{their}[0m belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than are Democratic members of [36m{Congress}[0m . 
(12) If [3m[32m{these assumptions}[0m hold , [33m{voters in races for Congress}[0m face what in economic theory is called [3m[34m{a prisoner 's dilemma}[0m and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic . 
(13) If [33m{they}[0m put [4m[33m{a Republican}[0m into office , not only will [33m{they}[0m acquire less in terms of local benefits but [33m{their}[0m selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent [1m[36m{other legislators}[0m from `` bringing home the bacon '' to [1m[36m{their}[0m respective constituencies . 
(14) Each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making . 
(15) In races for [1m[32m{the White House}[0m , [3m[34m{a voter 's}[0m incentive , at the margin , is to lean Republican . 
(16) Although a [1m[33m{GOP}[0m president may limit local benefits to [3m[34m{the voter 's}[0m particular district / state , such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts / states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits . 
(17) [3m[34m{The individual voter 's}[0m standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes . 
(18) While [3m[36m{this theory}[0m is exceedingly simple , [3m[36m{it}[0m appears to explain several things . 
(19) First , why [4m[31m{ticket splitting}[0m has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that [4m[31m{it}[0m has over [4m[36m{the past half century}[0m : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and [3m[34m{the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress}[0m was considerably less severe . 
(20) Second , [3m[36m{it}[0m explains why [1m[35m{voters}[0m hold [36m{Congress}[0m in disdain but generally love [1m[35m{their}[0m own congressional representatives : [3m[33m{Any individual legislator 's}[0m constituents appreciate the specific benefits that [3m[33m{the legislator}[0m wins for [3m[31m{them}[0m but not the overall cost associated with [1m[34m{every other legislator}[0m doing likewise for [1m[34m{his}[0m own constituency . 
(21) Third , [3m[36m{the theory}[0m suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit - seeking have lower security in office . 
(22) For example , first - term members of [1m[34m{the House}[0m , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have [3m[36m{become}[0m virtually immune to defeat . 
(23) The one exception to [3m[36m{this recent trend}[0m was the defeat of [31m{13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982}[0m . 
(24) Because [31m{these freshmen}[0m placed far more emphasis on [31m{their}[0m partisan role -- [1m[32m{spreading}[0m [4m[35m{the Reagan revolution}[0m -- in national policy making , [31m{they}[0m were more vulnerable to defeat . 
(25) Fourth , [3m[36m{the theory}[0m indicates why [1m[33m{the Republican Party}[0m may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office . 
(26) Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent . 
(27) To the extent that [4m[32m{potential Republican candidates}[0m and [4m[32m{their}[0m financial backers realize that [3m[34m{the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game}[0m works to [4m[32m{their}[0m disadvantage , [1m[33m{the Republican Party}[0m will be hindered in [1m[33m{its}[0m attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates . 
(28) Fifth , [3m[36m{the theory}[0m may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in [36m{the South}[0m . 
(29) To the extent that [35m{Democratic legislators from the South}[0m have held a disproportionate share of power in [36m{Congress}[0m since [4m[34m{1932}[0m and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for [35m{their}[0m respective constituencies , voters in [36m{the South}[0m have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office . 
(30) Finally , [3m[36m{the theory}[0m suggests why Republicans generally have [34m{fared}[0m better in [1m[35m{Senate}[0m races than in campaigns for [1m[34m{the House}[0m . 
(31) Since local benefit - seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in [1m[34m{the lower chamber of Congress}[0m , [34m{this}[0m is precisely the pattern one would expect if [3m[32m{Republicans}[0m are less willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than [3m[32m{their}[0m Democratic counterparts . 
(32) Is there any empirical support for this theory ? 
(33) Three pieces of evidence corroborate [3m[35m{the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than their Republican colleagues}[0m . 
(34) First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that [1m[33m{GOP}[0m senators [1m[36m{turn}[0m back roughly 10 % more of [32m{their}[0m allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do . 
(35) To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit - seeking , [1m[36m{this}[0m indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns . 
(36) Second , if [3m[35m{the key assumption}[0m is valid , Democrats should have [1m[31m{lower attendance rates on roll - call votes than Republicans do}[0m to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit - seeking . 
(37) [1m[31m{This}[0m is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of [1m[34m{the House}[0m . 
(38) The Democratic [1m[34m{House}[0m attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican [1m[34m{House}[0m attendance rate since 1959 . 
(39) Finally , as shown in [34m{the table}[0m , [3m[31m{Democrats}[0m allocate a higher proportion of [3m[31m{their}[0m personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit - seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices . 
(40) An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in [1m[35m{the Senate}[0m between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when control of [1m[35m{that body}[0m changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in [34m{the table}[0m can not be attributed to the disproportionate control [32m{Democrats}[0m exercise , due to [32m{their}[0m majority - party status , over other resources such as committee staff . 
(41) An additional piece of evidence from [1m[35m{the Senate}[0m : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a [1m[35m{Senate}[0m election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous [35m{the federal government 's}[0m tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher - income states harder -RRB- . 
(42) Put more simply , [1m[33m{GOP}[0m candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for [1m[35m{the Senate}[0m when [3m[34m{the prisoner 's dilemma}[0m is more severe . 
(43) Moreover , [3m[35m{ticket splitting}[0m appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as [3m[35m{it}[0m does at the federal level . 
(44) State government is more typically split along Republican - governor / Democratic - legislature lines than the reverse . 
(45) A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major - party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate . 
(46) In sum , at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation . 
(47) Mr. Zupan teaches at the University of Southern California 's business school .
