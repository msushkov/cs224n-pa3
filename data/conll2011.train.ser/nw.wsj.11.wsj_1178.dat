(0) [4m[32m{Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer , of Axa - Midi Assurances ,}[0m pledged to retain employees and management of [3m[36m{Farmers Group Inc.}[0m , including [3m[34m{Leo E. Denlea Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer}[0m , if [3m[32m{Axa}[0m succeeds in [4m[34m{acquiring}[0m [3m[36m{Farmers}[0m . 
(1) [4m[32m{Mr. Bebear}[0m added that [3m[32m{the French insurer}[0m would keep [3m[36m{Farmers '}[0m headquarters in Los Angeles and `` will not send French people to run [3m[36m{the company}[0m . '' 
(2) [3m[32m{Axa}[0m would also maintain [3m[36m{Farmers '}[0m relationships with [3m[35m{the insurance exchanges}[0m that [3m[36m{it}[0m manages . 
(3) [4m[32m{Mr. Bebear}[0m made [4m[32m{his}[0m remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here [1m[35m{yesterday}[0m as part of a tour in which [4m[32m{he}[0m is trying to rally support in the U.S. for [4m[34m{the proposed acquisition}[0m . 
(4) [4m[34m{The bid}[0m is part of [3m[31m{Sir James Goldsmith 's}[0m unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial - services giant that acquired [3m[36m{Farmers}[0m last year for $ 5.2 billion . 
(5) [3m[32m{Axa}[0m has agreed to acquire [3m[36m{Farmers}[0m from [3m[31m{Sir James 's}[0m investment vehicle , Hoylake Investments Ltd. , for $ 4.5 billion plus a $ 1 billion investment in [3m[33m{Hoylake}[0m . 
(6) Any acquisition of [3m[36m{Farmers}[0m needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where [3m[36m{Farmers}[0m operates , and [4m[32m{Mr. Bebear 's}[0m trip will take [4m[32m{him}[0m to [4m[31m{Idaho}[0m , [4m[35m{Arizona}[0m and New York after [4m[32m{his}[0m stay here ; [4m[32m{he}[0m will meet with insurance regulators , legislators , industry excutives and the press . 
(7) Hearings on [3m[32m{Axa 's}[0m acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in [4m[31m{Idaho}[0m ; Nov. 20 in Illinois ; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in [4m[35m{Arizona}[0m ; Dec. 11 in Washington state ; and Jan. 8 in Oregon . 
(8) Hearings have n't yet been set in Texas , Ohio and Kansas . 
(9) California 's insurance commissioner does n't hold hearings on acquisition applications . 
(10) Although [3m[32m{Axa}[0m has been rebuffed by [3m[36m{Farmers}[0m and has n't had any meetings with management , [4m[32m{Mr. Bebear}[0m nonetheless appears to be trying to woo [3m[36m{the company 's}[0m executives with promises of autonomy and new - found authority under [3m[32m{Axa}[0m . 
(11) [4m[32m{He}[0m said [3m[34m{Mr. Denlea}[0m would be a member of the top management team of [4m[33m{the Axa - Midi group of companies}[0m , and would `` help define policies and strategies of [4m[33m{the group}[0m . '' 
(12) [3m[36m{Farmers}[0m was quick [1m[35m{yesterday}[0m to point out the many negative aspects [3m[36m{it}[0m sees in having [3m[32m{Axa}[0m as [3m[36m{its}[0m parent . 
(13) For one , [3m[32m{Axa}[0m plans to do away with [1m[36m{certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $ 600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses}[0m . 
(14) [1m[36m{Those credits}[0m result because of taxes that [3m[36m{Farmers}[0m , as the management company , has paid , and have `` proved to be very important for [3m[35m{the exchanges}[0m , '' a [3m[36m{Farmers}[0m spokesman said . 
(15) [4m[32m{Mr. Bebear}[0m contended that the tax cost to [3m[35m{the exchanges}[0m under the revised structure would be about $ 8 million a year , which [4m[32m{he}[0m described as `` peanuts .
