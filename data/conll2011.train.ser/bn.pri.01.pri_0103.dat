(0) This week a court in New York began selecting the jury for [4m[32m{the trial of 4 men charged with killing the 12 Americans who died in the bombings of the United States ' embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two years ago}[0m . 
(1) [3m[35m{Two hundred twenty four people}[0m died in [35m{the simultaneous attacks}[0m , more than 200 of [3m[35m{them}[0m Kenyans . 
(2) For [1m[32m{the survivors , many of them severely injured}[0m , the year since [35m{the bombings}[0m have been hard . 
(3) [1m[31m{The BBC 's}[0m Cathy Drinkins in [3m[32m{Nairobi}[0m met up with [4m[35m{some of those trying to rebuild their lives from the ruins of the Kenya embassy blast}[0m . 
(4) [3m[34m{I}[0m heard a loud sound here and then we tried to look the window . 
(5) [3m[34m{I}[0m later realized that [3m[34m{I}[0m was down . 
(6) [3m[34m{I}[0m could n't remember what happened thereafter and [3m[34m{I}[0m found [3m[34m{myself}[0m in the hospital . 
(7) [3m[34m{Beatrice Ketch}[0m was 23 when the bomb ripped out the windows of the office where [3m[34m{she}[0m worked opposite the embassy . 
(8) [3m[34m{Beatrice}[0m is lucky in that [3m[34m{she}[0m has been able to return to a job as a secretary , but [3m[34m{she}[0m is still having treatment for scars on [3m[34m{her}[0m legs and arms and face . 
(9) [3m[34m{I}[0m feel very bad because [3m[34m{I}[0m want to have the very face [3m[34m{I}[0m used to have before , yeah . 
(10) [3m[34m{I}[0m want to look beautiful . 
(11) [1m[36m{This scar alone}[0m makes [3m[34m{me}[0m not look beautiful . 
(12) Yeah , but you can hardly see [1m[36m{it}[0m . 
(13) [1m[36m{It}[0m is just under [3m[34m{your}[0m chin . 
(14) Yeah , [1m[36m{it}[0m 's under [3m[34m{my}[0m chin , but there is also one on [3m[34m{my}[0m hand here . 
(15) Most people ask [3m[34m{me}[0m what was wrong . 
(16) [3m[33m{Some people}[0m think maybe we were fighting with someone so [3m[34m{I}[0m have to explain to [3m[33m{them}[0m that this one was as a result of [4m[33m{the bomb blast}[0m . 
(17) [1m[33m{Another victim , 36 - year - old Simon Macharia}[0m has had the unenviable task of trying to explain to policemen that [1m[33m{he}[0m has n't fallen asleep drunk on a pavement , but has simply been confused . 
(18) Since [4m[33m{the bombing}[0m [1m[33m{he}[0m has had psychological problems and has found [1m[33m{himself}[0m locked in a police cell on three occasions after being picked up . 
(19) [1m[33m{Simon}[0m lived in one of [3m[32m{Nairobi 's}[0m sprawling slums and [1m[33m{he}[0m has had to give up [1m[33m{his}[0m job delivering milk because of a hand injury sustained in [4m[33m{the blast}[0m . 
(20) Life for [1m[33m{him}[0m , [1m[33m{his}[0m wife and [1m[33m{his}[0m 6 children has been very difficult . 
(21) [4m[31m{My wife}[0m , [4m[31m{she}[0m does n't just understand [1m[33m{me}[0m because one thing [4m[31m{she}[0m does n't know what 's going on . 
(22) [1m[33m{I}[0m just feel a lot of fury and a lot of anger in [1m[33m{me}[0m . 
(23) [1m[33m{My}[0m money got finished and then [1m[33m{my}[0m child comes , who needs a book , needs this . 
(24) [1m[33m{I}[0m do n't have . 
(25) [4m[36m{Their}[0m mother is not able to do that . 
(26) It 's been hard to cope with this situation . 
(27) [1m[33m{Simon}[0m and [3m[34m{Beatrice}[0m are among some 3000 Kenyans who have filed for [4m[34m{compensation}[0m in [34m{the United States}[0m with the help of American lawyers . 
(28) The legal rendings over the claims will begin soon , but according to Solomon Ombobia of [32m{the Bomb Blast Legal Rights Project in Nairobi}[0m , [4m[34m{the money}[0m is needed now . 
(29) [32m{We}[0m have seen [33m{people}[0m suffering . 
(30) [32m{We}[0m even go to an extent of helping [33m{them}[0m even to get [33m{their}[0m bus fare . 
(31) [3m[36m{It}[0m has taken too long . 
(32) [34m{Some people}[0m even come for assistance to even get money so that [34m{they}[0m can reach to hospitals , so [3m[36m{it}[0m has taken too long . 
(33) After two and half years , [4m[32m{the trial}[0m is now getting underway in [34m{the United States}[0m , of [31m{four of the men accused of being behind the bombings}[0m . 
(34) [3m[34m{Beatrice Ketch}[0m wants justice to be done . 
(35) What [3m[34m{I}[0m feel is [31m{those people}[0m , [31m{they}[0m have to be punished severely because so many lives were lost at that time . 
(36) Most people were injured . 
(37) So [3m[34m{me}[0m , what [3m[34m{I}[0m want is that [31m{they}[0m should be punished . 
(38) But [1m[35m{the man the United States believes masterminded the attacks , Osama Bin Laden}[0m is still at large . 
(39) [34m{The US government}[0m has offered a 5 million dollar reward for information which would lead to [1m[35m{his}[0m arrest and of other suspects . 
(40) For the bombing victims , justice and compensation could still be a long way off . 
(41) That 's [1m[31m{the BBC 's}[0m Cathy Jenkins in [3m[32m{Nairobi}[0m .
