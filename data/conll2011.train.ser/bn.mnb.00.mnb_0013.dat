(0) And good evening to you . 
(1) There is still no clear winner in the election that was now two nights ago . 
(2) [3m[34m{A recount}[0m under way in [1m[36m{Florida}[0m , and it may not end there . 
(3) Here is the status of [3m[34m{the recount}[0m as of this hour . 
(4) The two candidates [4m[33m{separated}[0m by only 225 votes , with [3m[36m{65 out of 67 counties}[0m reporting . 
(5) [4m[34m{It}[0m has narrowed dramatically [4m[31m{all day}[0m long . 
(6) [4m[31m{Today}[0m [3m[32m{the Gore campaign}[0m seemed to say the case belongs in [1m[36m{Florida}[0m state courts . 
(7) The [3m[35m{Bush}[0m campaign chided right back that [3m[32m{the other side}[0m wants to keep voting until [3m[32m{they}[0m like the and increasingly across [3m[31m{the nation}[0m you can hear [1m[32m{it}[0m and feel [1m[32m{it}[0m . 
(8) [1m[32m{The split}[0m now palpable . 
(9) There 's and among partisan , anger . 
(10) [33m{Americans}[0m remain glued to [33m{their}[0m television sets , but no answer is coming out and even Cuba remarked [35m{tonight}[0m in an official statement that it sure is taking [3m[31m{America}[0m a long time to pick a . 
(11) Odd pairings [35m{tonight}[0m at [4m[35m{the White House}[0m when all [3m[31m{the nation 's}[0m living presidents except Reagan were together at [4m[35m{the White House}[0m celebrating the 200th anniversary of [4m[35m{the grand house}[0m . 
(12) There was [3m[35m{George W. Bush 's}[0m dad alongside the President [35m{tonight}[0m for a photo op . 
(13) We have correspondents [35m{tonight}[0m . 
(14) First to [31m{the Florida capital}[0m and [34m{legal correspondent Dan Abrams in Tallahassee}[0m . 
(15) [4m[32m{Brian}[0m , [4m[31m{this}[0m was supposed to be the day when [36m{we}[0m were going to have a final decision , [36m{we}[0m were going to know what is the result of [3m[34m{the recount in Florida}[0m . 
(16) Not to be the case . 
(17) The official results showing [4m[36m{only 53 of the 67 counties}[0m have issued [4m[36m{their}[0m recount results and provided [1m[33m{them}[0m to [1m[36m{the state government here}[0m . 
(18) On the other hand , as [4m[32m{you}[0m reported just a moment ago , [1m[31m{the Associated Press}[0m reporting that [3m[36m{65 of the 67 counties}[0m have reported . 
(19) The problem is [34m{the numbers}[0m are so very different . 
(20) On the one hand you have [1m[31m{the Associated Press}[0m saying [4m[33m{225 - vote difference after 65 counties}[0m . 
(21) You have the officials here saying after [4m[36m{53 counties}[0m , exactly the same number difference that it was when [3m[34m{the recount}[0m began , 1,784 , and if you watch the way [34m{these numbers}[0m have been coming in , [32m{the Associated Press numbers}[0m have constantly made [4m[34m{it}[0m closer and closer , [1m[35m{Gore}[0m gaining ground on [3m[35m{Bush}[0m with almost every county 's result . 
(22) On the other hand , [3m[33m{the official numbers that have been coming in}[0m keep seesawing . 
(23) [3m[35m{Bush}[0m gets a few more , [1m[35m{Gore}[0m gets a few more and we 're back to even again , according to state officials . 
(24) So when we get the two remaining counties will that be [1m[34m{the best number going}[0m ? 
(25) [34m{I}[0m do n't know if to be [1m[34m{the best number}[0m . 
(26) [34m{I}[0m just ca n't believe [34m{these numbers}[0m are going to end up matching at the end . 
(27) MSNBC 
(28) Because as [1m[31m{A.P.}[0m has continued with [1m[31m{its}[0m numbers the progression has been consistent . 
(29) Every time [1m[31m{they}[0m gave you a set of counties that have been evaluated , [1m[35m{Gore}[0m was getting closer and closer . 
(30) On the other hand , with every group of counties reporting officially it remained about even . 
(31) So in the end , [4m[32m{Brian}[0m , [34m{I}[0m think [3m[33m{the official numbers}[0m will be the numbers that apply but we 'll have to wait and see when all 67 are counted by both . 
(32) Thank [34m{you}[0m for that . 
(33) And there are still several thousand absentee votes .
