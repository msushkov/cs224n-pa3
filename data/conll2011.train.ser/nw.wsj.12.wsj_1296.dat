(0) [3m[34m{At least 10 states}[0m are resisting [4m[33m{Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's}[0m nationwide effort to settle [4m[33m{its}[0m legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke [4m[33m{the firm 's}[0m license to sell securities within [3m[34m{their}[0m borders . 
(1) The reluctance of some states to let [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m off the hook could hamper [4m[33m{the firm 's}[0m attempts to polish [4m[33m{its}[0m image after [4m[33m{its}[0m guilty plea to [1m[34m{six felonies}[0m last month , say several people familiar with [1m[32m{the discussions}[0m . 
(2) Up to now , [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m has made a rapid - fire series of settlements with [3m[32m{25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico}[0m . 
(3) Just yesterday , [3m[33m{New Hampshire}[0m announced [3m[33m{it}[0m made a $ 75,000 settlement with [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m , a record - tying fine for a securities - law matter in [3m[33m{that state}[0m . 
(4) [3m[32m{These states}[0m have been entering into settlements with [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m as part of [4m[33m{the firm 's}[0m efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite [4m[33m{its}[0m record as an admitted felon . 
(5) But individuals familiar with [1m[32m{the generally successful Drexel talks}[0m say [4m[33m{the firm}[0m is meeting resistance from [1m[36m{some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri}[0m . 
(6) [3m[35m{Officials in some of these states}[0m say [3m[35m{they}[0m do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m . 
(7) [3m[35m{They}[0m question if [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m is getting easier treatment than the many small penny - stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked . 
(8) [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of [4m[33m{its}[0m criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties . 
(9) These stem from a two - year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street . 
(10) Ohio , the District of Columbia , Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m than [32m{the other six states}[0m , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with [1m[32m{the discussions}[0m . 
(11) [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m says [4m[33m{it}[0m does n't expect any of [4m[33m{its}[0m state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , [4m[33m{its}[0m securities business would n't be directly hurt . 
(12) [4m[33m{It}[0m already has sold [4m[33m{its}[0m retail , or individual - investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking . 
(13) Still , if nothing else , [33m{a revoked brokerage license}[0m could be a burden because [33m{it}[0m must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m could be involved . 
(14) [4m[34m{Securities regulators}[0m praise [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m for [4m[33m{its}[0m energetic effort , led by [4m[35m{government - approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen}[0m , to settle [4m[33m{its}[0m legal problems with the states . 
(15) But [4m[34m{they}[0m disagree about [3m[31m{the message these settlements give to the public}[0m . 
(16) `` There was a lot of internal debate about [3m[31m{that specific issue}[0m , '' said [34m{Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel}[0m . 
(17) The question , [34m{she}[0m said , is whether [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m should be allowed to pay and move on , or `` whether you should -LRB- simply -RRB- revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony . '' 
(18) While [34m{Ms. Bryant 's}[0m state went ahead and accepted [4m[33m{Drexel 's}[0m settlement offer of $ 25,000 , [34m{she}[0m said : `` [34m{I}[0m do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions . 
(19) [34m{I}[0m can see both sides . '' 
(20) Similarly , [1m[31m{Alfred Rubega , New Hampshire 's director of securities regulation ,}[0m said [1m[31m{his}[0m state had n't received any complaints about [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m , so [3m[33m{it}[0m really could n't press the issue . 
(21) Still , `` [1m[31m{I}[0m understand the reasons '' that other states are holding out , [1m[31m{he}[0m said . 
(22) [4m[35m{Mr. Cohen , the Drexel general counsel ,}[0m said , `` [4m[35m{I}[0m do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' [4m[33m{we}[0m 'll be losing any licenses . '' 
(23) Asked about states that are taking a hard line , [4m[35m{he}[0m said , `` There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . '' 
(24) [4m[35m{Mr. Cohen}[0m said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million . 
(25) By the end of this week , [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m should have another three to four settlements , [4m[35m{Mr. Cohen}[0m said . 
(26) `` The rate we 're going , [4m[35m{I}[0m think that by the end of the month , [4m[33m{we}[0m 're looking to have [1m[36m{a total of 30 to 35}[0m , '' [4m[35m{he}[0m said . 
(27) [1m[36m{That total}[0m would be important for [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m . 
(28) [4m[33m{The investment bank}[0m has previously announced that as part of [4m[33m{its}[0m punishment [4m[33m{it}[0m would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry . 
(29) A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday . 
(30) There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m or who do n't appear opposed to settling . 
(31) [4m[33m{Drexel 's}[0m proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of [4m[33m{Drexel 's}[0m business in the state . 
(32) [4m[32m{New Jersey}[0m , for example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused . 
(33) [4m[32m{The state}[0m is n't ruling out revoking [4m[33m{Drexel 's}[0m brokerage license . 
(34) [4m[32m{The state}[0m can also bar [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m as an investment adviser . 
(35) [1m[35m{State officials}[0m wo n't describe [1m[35m{their}[0m position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , state securities chief , said : `` [4m[32m{We}[0m really are still looking at [35m{it}[0m and have informed -LRB- [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m -RRB- that [35m{the proposal}[0m is really not sufficient for settlement . '' 
(36) [4m[36m{Connecticut}[0m already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke [4m[33m{Drexel 's}[0m brokerage license . 
(37) [4m[36m{It}[0m is one of the states that have met with [4m[35m{Mr. Cohen}[0m and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters . 
(38) `` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital - formation market , '' [1m[33m{state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown}[0m said . 
(39) A banking department spokesman added : `` [1m[33m{Commissioner Brown}[0m does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . '' 
(40) Particularly touchy are the cases of [1m[34m{New York , which is Drexel 's base ,}[0m and [4m[31m{California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk - bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties}[0m . 
(41) Neither state has settled , and [1m[33m{officials in the two states}[0m wo n't discuss [1m[33m{their}[0m reasons for not doing so . 
(42) But [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m has made it clear [4m[33m{it}[0m could mount a significant legal battle in each state if [4m[33m{its}[0m license is revoked , according to state officials . 
(43) [34m{Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group ,}[0m said [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m has done a better job of settling with the states than [1m[35m{E.F. Hutton}[0m did after [1m[35m{its}[0m guilty plea to a massive check - kiting scheme several years ago . 
(44) Still , [34m{she}[0m said , [4m[33m{Drexel 's}[0m trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . 
(45) `` [36m{This process}[0m should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' [34m{Ms. Bryant}[0m said . 
(46) `` We need to have somebody worried so [4m[33m{they}[0m do n't do [1m[34m{this}[0m again . '' 
(47) [3m[32m{These}[0m are the 26 states , including [3m[36m{the commonwealth of Puerto Rico}[0m , that have settled with [4m[33m{Drexel}[0m : Alaska , Arkansas , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Mississippi , [3m[33m{New Hampshire}[0m , New Mexico , North Dakota , [1m[32m{Oklahoma}[0m , Oregon , South Carolina , South Dakota , Utah , Vermont , Washington , Wyoming and Puerto Rico .
