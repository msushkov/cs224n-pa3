(0) In a nondescript office building south of Los Angeles , human behavior is being monitored , dissected and , ultimately , manipulated . 
(1) A squiggly line snakes across a video screen , gyrating erratically as [31m{subjects with hand - held computers}[0m register [31m{their}[0m second - by - second reactions to a speaker 's remarks . 
(2) Agreement , disapproval , boredom and distraction all can be inferred from [31m{the subjects '}[0m twist of a dial . 
(3) In another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how [4m[31m{people 's opinions}[0m were shaped -- and how [4m[31m{they}[0m can be reshaped . 
(4) [4m[33m{Donald Vinson , who oversees the experiments ,}[0m is n't some white - coated researcher . 
(5) [4m[33m{He}[0m heads [36m{Litigation Sciences Inc. , the nation 's largest legal consulting firm , which is helping corporate America prepare for high - stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions}[0m . 
(6) In the process , [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m is quietly but inexorably reshaping [3m[32m{the world of law}[0m . 
(7) Little known outside [3m[32m{the legal world}[0m but a powerhouse within , [36m{Litigation Sciences , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC ,}[0m employs more than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians . 
(8) Twenty - one of [36m{its}[0m workers are Ph. D.s . 
(9) Among other services , [36m{the firm}[0m provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' jurors , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' juries , coaches lawyers and witnesses , and designs courtroom graphics . 
(10) Much like [36m{their}[0m cohorts in political consulting and product marketing , [36m{the litigation advisers}[0m encourage [36m{their}[0m clients to play down complex or ambiguous matters , simplify [1m[31m{their}[0m messages and provide [1m[31m{their}[0m target audiences with a psychological craving to make the desired choice . 
(11) With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time , companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice . 
(12) Recently , [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m helped Pennzoil Co. win a $ 10.5 billion jury verdict against Texaco Inc . 
(13) [36m{It}[0m advised [4m[36m{the National Football League}[0m in [4m[36m{its}[0m largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League . 
(14) And [36m{it}[0m helped win defense verdicts in product - liability suits involving scores of products , ranging from Firestone 500 tires to the anti-nausea drug Bendectin . 
(15) Largely as a result , [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m has more than doubled in size in the past two years . 
(16) [36m{Its}[0m 1988 revenue was $ 25 million . 
(17) Meanwhile , competitors are being spawned almost daily ; some 300 new businesses -- many just one - person shops -- have sprung up . 
(18) [4m[33m{Mr. Vinson}[0m estimates the industry 's total revenues approach $ 200 million . 
(19) In any high - stakes case , you can be sure that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants . 
(20) Despite [3m[33m{their}[0m ubiquity , [3m[33m{the consultants}[0m are n't entirely welcome . 
(21) Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen . 
(22) In the film classic `` Twelve Angry Men , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks [1m[34m{each juror 's bias}[0m and purges [1m[34m{it}[0m from playing a role in the verdict . 
(23) After hours of conflict and debate , that jury [4m[35m{focuses}[0m on the facts with near - perfect objectivity . 
(24) In real life , [31m{jurors}[0m may not always work [4m[35m{that way}[0m , but some court observers question why [31m{they}[0m should n't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to . 
(25) Litigation consulting is , as [1m[33m{New York trial attorney Donald Zoeller}[0m puts it , `` highly manipulative . '' 
(26) [1m[33m{He}[0m adds , `` The notion they try to sell is that juries do n't make decisions rationally . 
(27) But the [3m[31m{effort}[0m is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally . 
(28) [1m[33m{I}[0m find [3m[31m{it}[0m troubling . '' 
(29) But [1m[33m{Mr. Zoeller}[0m also acknowledges that [3m[33m{consultants}[0m can be very effective . 
(30) `` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use [3m[33m{them}[0m , '' [1m[33m{he}[0m says . 
(31) Others complain that [1m[32m{the consultants ' growing influence}[0m exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services . 
(32) `` The affluent people and the corporations can buy [1m[32m{it}[0m , the poor radicals -LCB- in political cases -RCB- get [1m[32m{it}[0m free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says [3m[33m{Amitai Etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University}[0m . 
(33) [4m[32m{Sophisticated trial consulting}[0m grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding [4m[32m{its}[0m more lucrative calling in big commercial cases . 
(34) [1m[33m{The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war - related violence ,}[0m was a landmark . 
(35) In [1m[33m{that case}[0m , a group of left - leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg . 
(36) The researchers discovered that [4m[31m{Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants}[0m were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved to try to keep [4m[31m{them}[0m off [1m[34m{the jury}[0m . 
(37) The defense also learned that college - educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War . 
(38) A more blue - collar panel became a second aim . 
(39) Ultimately , [1m[34m{that carefully picked jury}[0m deadlocked with a 10 - 2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case . 
(40) [32m{Litigation consulting}[0m had arrived . 
(41) [32m{The fledgling science}[0m went corporate in 1977 when [1m[35m{International Business Machines Corp.}[0m hired [4m[33m{a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case}[0m . 
(42) The problem for [33m{IBM trial lawyers Thomas Barr and David Boies}[0m was how to make [3m[35m{such a highly technical case}[0m understandable . 
(43) As [3m[31m{the trial}[0m progressed , [33m{they}[0m were eager to know if [4m[32m{the jury}[0m was keeping up with [33m{them}[0m . 
(44) The solution devised by [4m[33m{the professor}[0m was to hire six people who would mirror [4m[32m{the actual jury}[0m demographically , sit in on [3m[31m{the trial}[0m and report their reactions to [4m[33m{him}[0m . 
(45) [4m[33m{He}[0m then briefed [33m{Messrs. Boies and Barr , who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation accordingly}[0m . 
(46) Thus , the `` shadow '' jury was born . 
(47) [4m[33m{Mr. Vinson , the professor ,}[0m got the law bug and formed [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m . 
(48) -LRB- [1m[35m{IBM}[0m won [3m[35m{the case}[0m . -RRB- 
(49) `` The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , '' says [36m{Mr. Boies of Cravath , Swaine & Moore}[0m . 
(50) `` What you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give [3m[35m{an opening argument}[0m to your wife or a friend and get some response to [3m[35m{it}[0m . 
(51) [4m[35m{A shadow jury}[0m is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . '' 
(52) [4m[35m{The approach}[0m worked well in [1m[33m{the recent antitrust case in which Energy Transportation Systems Inc. sued Santa Fe Pacific Corp. over the transport of semi-liquefied coal -- the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes glaze over}[0m . 
(53) [3m[34m{Energy Transportation}[0m retained [36m{Litigation Sciences , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow}[0m . 
(54) Just before the actual closing arguments , [36m{the firm}[0m put [1m[33m{the case}[0m to a vote of [36m{the five shadow jurors , each of whom was being paid $ 150 a day}[0m . 
(55) [36m{The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them ,}[0m decided for [3m[34m{Energy Transportation}[0m , and awarded $ 500 million in damages . 
(56) The real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million victory for [3m[34m{Energy Transportation}[0m . 
(57) `` [4m[33m{It}[0m 's just like weather forecasting , '' says [3m[34m{Energy Transportation}[0m trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins . 
(58) `` [4m[33m{It}[0m 's often wrong , but [4m[33m{it}[0m 's better than consulting an Indian rain dancer . '' 
(59) [4m[33m{Forecasting}[0m is only one part of [36m{Litigation Sciences '}[0m work . 
(60) Changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters . 
(61) And to the uninitiated , some of [36m{the firm 's}[0m approaches may seem chillingly manipulative . 
(62) Theoretically , jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in [3m[34m{a case}[0m logically and objectively . 
(63) Instead , [4m[33m{Mr. Vinson}[0m says , interviews with [1m[34m{thousands of jurors}[0m reveal that [1m[34m{they}[0m start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe - horn the facts of [3m[34m{the case}[0m to fit [1m[34m{their}[0m views . 
(64) Pre-trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror . 
(65) If it is a case in which the client seeks [4m[32m{punitive damages}[0m , for example , depressed , underemployed people are far more likely to grant [4m[32m{them}[0m . 
(66) Someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal , [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m advises . 
(67) So would someone recently divorced or widowed . 
(68) -LRB- Since [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m generally represents the defense , [36m{its}[0m job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury . -RRB- 
(69) For personal - injury cases , [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m seeks defense jurors who believe that [1m[36m{most people , including victims ,}[0m get what [1m[36m{they}[0m deserve . 
(70) Such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women . 
(71) [36m{The consultants}[0m help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books . 
(72) [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m does n't make moral distinctions . 
(73) If a client needs [1m[35m{prejudiced jurors}[0m , [36m{the firm}[0m will help find [1m[35m{them}[0m . 
(74) As [4m[33m{Mr. Vinson}[0m explains it , `` [36m{We}[0m do n't control [4m[34m{the facts}[0m . 
(75) [4m[34m{They}[0m are what [4m[34m{they}[0m are . 
(76) But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ . 
(77) In our system of advocacy , [33m{the trial lawyer}[0m is duty bound to present the best case [33m{he}[0m possibly can . '' 
(78) Once a jury is selected , [36m{the consultants}[0m often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' presentation accordingly . 
(79) Logic plays a minimal role here . 
(80) More important are what [36m{LSI}[0m calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level . 
(81) In one personal - injury case , [4m[34m{a woman}[0m claimed [4m[34m{she}[0m had been injured when [4m[34m{she}[0m [32m{slipped}[0m in a pool , but [32m{the fall}[0m did n't explain why [4m[31m{one of her arms}[0m was discolored bluish . 
(82) By repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to [4m[31m{the arm}[0m , [3m[36m{the defense lawyers}[0m [35m{planted}[0m doubt about the origin of [4m[34m{the woman 's}[0m injuries . 
(83) [35m{The ploy}[0m worked . 
(84) [3m[36m{The defense}[0m won . 
(85) In a classic defense of a personal - injury case , the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame . 
(86) `` The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold [3m[35m{the accident victim}[0m responsible for [3m[35m{his}[0m or [3m[35m{her}[0m plight , '' [4m[33m{Mr. Vinson}[0m has written . 
(87) Slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in [36m{Litigation Sciences '}[0m operation . 
(88) Studies show , [36m{the consultants}[0m say , that [3m[32m{people}[0m absorb [3m[36m{information}[0m better and remember [3m[36m{it}[0m longer if [3m[32m{they}[0m receive [3m[36m{it}[0m visually . 
(89) Computer - generated videos help . 
(90) `` [3m[32m{The average American}[0m watches seven hours of TV a day . 
(91) [3m[32m{They}[0m are very visually sophisticated , '' explains [36m{LSI}[0m graphics specialist Robert Seltzer . 
(92) Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with [1m[36m{all this}[0m . 
(93) [35m{Supporters}[0m acknowledge that [1m[36m{the process}[0m aims to manipulate , but [35m{they}[0m insist that [34m{the best trial lawyers}[0m have always employed [3m[31m{similar tactics}[0m . 
(94) `` [34m{They}[0m may not have been able to articulate [3m[31m{it all}[0m , but [34m{they}[0m did [3m[31m{it}[0m , '' says Stephen Gillers , a legal ethics expert at New York University law school . 
(95) `` What you have here is intuition made manifest . '' 
(96) Many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence . 
(97) Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had [1m[32m{a feel for public sentiment}[0m -- and used [1m[32m{that}[0m to advantage . 
(98) Litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome . 
(99) [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m concedes that in one in 20 cases [36m{it}[0m was flatout wrong in [36m{its}[0m predictions . 
(100) A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant -LRB- not at [36m{Litigation Sciences}[0m -RRB- $ 70,000 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in The American Lawyer magazine . 
(101) [34m{Some litigators}[0m scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than [34m{they}[0m do about what makes a jury tick . 
(102) `` The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , '' says [3m[36m{Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett , who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co}[0m . 
(103) [3m[36m{He}[0m says [3m[36m{he}[0m used [1m[31m{consultants}[0m in [1m[36m{the case}[0m but `` found [1m[31m{them}[0m to be virtually useless . '' 
(104) But most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken . 
(105) And the question remains whether [1m[31m{the jury system}[0m can maintain [1m[31m{its}[0m integrity while undergoing such a skillful massage . 
(106) For more than a decade , [3m[33m{Mr. Etzioni , the sociologist ,}[0m has been a leading critic of the masseurs . 
(107) `` There 's no reason to believe that [3m[34m{juries}[0m rule inappropriately , '' [3m[33m{he}[0m says . 
(108) `` But the last thing you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make [3m[34m{them}[0m think better . 
(109) What you then do is you make [3m[34m{them}[0m think inappropriately . '' 
(110) To hamper the work of litigation scientists , [3m[33m{he}[0m suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so - called peremptory challenges -- exclusions that do n't require explanations . 
(111) In most civil cases , judges allow each side three such challenges . 
(112) For complex cases , judges sometimes allow many more . 
(113) [3m[33m{Mr. Etzioni}[0m also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors . 
(114) -LRB- Some courts release names and addresses , and researchers can drive by houses , look up credit ratings , and even question neighbors . -RRB- 
(115) Furthermore , [3m[33m{he}[0m says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities . 
(116) Even some lawyers who have used [1m[35m{consultants}[0m to their advantage see a need to limit [1m[35m{their}[0m impact . 
(117) [36m{Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services ,}[0m cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning -LRB- known as voir dire -RRB- or giving out personal information about the jurors . 
(118) `` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you [1m[32m{make}[0m it for that kind of research to be effective , and [36m{I}[0m do n't think [4m[36m{courts}[0m should lend [4m[36m{themselves}[0m to [1m[32m{that}[0m , '' [36m{Mr. Boies}[0m says .
