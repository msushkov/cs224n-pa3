(0) About 400,000 commuters trying to find their way through the Bay area 's quake - torn transportation system wedged cheek - to - jowl into subways , sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses [32m{yesterday}[0m . 
(1) In other words , it was a better - than - average Manhattan commute . 
(2) City officials feared widespread gridlock on [32m{the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last Tuesday 's earthquake}[0m . 
(3) [1m[34m{The massive temblor , which killed at least 61 people ,}[0m severed [4m[31m{the Bay Bridge , a major artery to the east}[0m , and closed most ramps leading to and from [31m{Highway 101 , the biggest artery to the south}[0m . 
(4) It will take several weeks to repair [4m[31m{the bridge}[0m , and several months to repair some of the [31m{101}[0m connections . 
(5) But in spite of a wind - driven rainstorm , gridlock never materialized , mainly because [3m[31m{the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system}[0m carried 50 % more passengers than normal . 
(6) For the first time in memory , it was standing - room only in [3m[31m{BART 's}[0m sleek , modern railcars . 
(7) Moreover , the two main bridges still connecting [4m[33m{San Francisco}[0m with [3m[35m{the East Bay}[0m did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping . 
(8) Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours , or that many workers are still staying at home . 
(9) [4m[36m{Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge , which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span ,}[0m actually may have reached work a bit faster on [3m[31m{BART}[0m [32m{yesterday}[0m , provided [4m[36m{they}[0m could find a parking space at [3m[31m{the system 's}[0m jammed stations . 
(10) In the best of times , [4m[31m{the Bay Bridge}[0m is the worst commute in the region , often experiencing back - ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more . 
(11) Not that getting into [4m[33m{town}[0m was easy . 
(12) Storm flooding caused back - ups on the freeway , and many commuters had to find rides to [3m[31m{BART 's}[0m stations , because parking lots were full before dawn . 
(13) Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray , stranding commuters such as [3m[33m{Marilyn Sullivan}[0m . 
(14) [3m[33m{Her}[0m commute from Petaluma , Calif. , normally takes an hour and 15 minutes , via [34m{the Golden Gate Bridge , which connects San Francisco with the North Bay area}[0m . 
(15) [32m{Yesterday}[0m , [3m[33m{she}[0m was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours , trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district . 
(16) `` It 's worse than [3m[33m{I}[0m thought , '' [3m[33m{she}[0m said . 
(17) `` [3m[33m{I}[0m do n't know where all the buses are . '' 
(18) But while [3m[36m{traffic}[0m was heavy early in the commute over [34m{the Golden Gate}[0m , by 8 a.m. [3m[36m{it}[0m already had thinned out . 
(19) `` It 's one of the smoothest commutes [3m[32m{I}[0m 've ever had , '' said [3m[32m{Charles Catania , an insurance broker on the bus from Mill Valley in Marin County}[0m . 
(20) `` It looks like a holiday . 
(21) [3m[32m{I}[0m think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . '' 
(22) However , a spokeswoman for [3m[34m{BankAmerica Corp.}[0m said [32m{yesterday 's}[0m absenteeism at [3m[34m{the bank holding company}[0m was no greater than on an average day . 
(23) At the San Mateo Bridge , which connects the San Francisco peninsula with [3m[35m{the East Bay}[0m , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved . 
(24) `` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated , '' said Stan Perez , a sergeant with the California Highway Patrol . 
(25) There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role . 
(26) [34m{The Golden Gate}[0m handled as many cars as normally [32m{yesterday}[0m , but over four hours rather than the usual two - hour crush . 
(27) [33m{Bechtel Group Inc. , the giant closely held engineering concern ,}[0m says [33m{it}[0m has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any eight - hour period during those hours to go to work . 
(28) Of [33m{Bechtel 's}[0m 17,500 employees , [4m[32m{about 4,000}[0m work in [4m[33m{San Francisco}[0m -- one - third of [4m[32m{them}[0m commuting from [3m[35m{stricken East Bay}[0m . 
(29) [4m[34m{Pacific Gas & Electric Co.}[0m is offering [4m[34m{its}[0m 6,000 [4m[33m{San Francisco}[0m employees [4m[35m{a two - tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m}[0m . 
(30) [4m[35m{The flextime}[0m may cut by almost a third the number of [4m[34m{PG&E}[0m employees working conventional 9 - 5 hours , a spokesman says . 
(31) Some of [4m[34m{the utility 's}[0m employees may opt for a four - day workweek , 10 hours a day , to cut the commute by 20 % . 
(32) At [1m[36m{Pacific Telesis Group}[0m , flextime is left up to individual working groups , because some of [1m[36m{the telephone company 's}[0m employees must be on - site during normal business hours , a spokeswoman says . 
(33) [35m{Some individuals}[0m went to some lengths on [35m{their}[0m own to avoid the anticipated gridlock . 
(34) [36m{One senior vice president at Bechtel}[0m said [36m{he}[0m got up at 3 a.m. to drive into [4m[33m{San Francisco}[0m from [3m[35m{the East Bay}[0m . 
(35) But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last . 
(36) Although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two - thirds of the motorists crossing [34m{the Golden Gate}[0m were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate . 
(37) And [1m[35m{some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock ,}[0m were planning to return to [1m[35m{their}[0m old ways .
