(7) The convention is going to be here in the city of New York . 
(8) That 's not the question [3m[34m{I}[0m asked [3m[32m{you}[0m . 
(9) What [3m[32m{I}[0m 'm going to do ? 
(10) That 's so far in the future . 
(11) Would [3m[32m{you}[0m consider a run for governor .

(15) Speaking of [3m[31m{the presidency}[0m , [3m[32m{you}[0m said it would be arrogant to talk about [3m[31m{that office}[0m when [3m[31m{it}[0m 's not under serious consideration . 
(16) Is [3m[31m{that}[0m something that [3m[32m{you}[0m 've ever given a glancing thought to ? 
(17) [3m[32m{I}[0m do n't think you do unless it 's realistic .
