(0) All right . 
(1) Just about 25 minutes long in that press conference there at [1m[34m{NATO}[0m headquarters in Brussels . 
(2) He mentioned a headline a short time ago . 
(3) U.S. forces moving in on the airports at Saddam Hussein International Airport , 12 miles west of the city 's center . 
(4) [35m{Colin Powell}[0m saying an end will come soon and toward the end , this regime will be finished . 
(5) Also a question there about [31m{the United Nations}[0m . 
(6) A question about [1m[34m{NATO}[0m about what role these two organizations may play in rebuilding [32m{Iraq}[0m . 
(7) [35m{Colin Powell}[0m says [31m{the U.N.}[0m does have [1m[33m{a role to play}[0m , what role [1m[33m{that}[0m is remains to be seen . 
(8) There was also one other moment there when you heard [33m{a woman}[0m asking about the safety of [33m{her}[0m husband right now . 
(9) [33m{That woman}[0m , we believe is married to [1m[31m{one of two journalists who disappeared in Iraq almost two weeks ago}[0m , [1m[32m{both}[0m work for the network , ITN . 
(10) [36m{We}[0m have heard that perhaps [1m[32m{both}[0m are being held in Basra , possibly in a hospital , but there 's no way for [36m{us}[0m to confirm [1m[32m{their}[0m whereabouts . 
(11) But obviously a lot of concern from [33m{this woman}[0m as to whereabouts of [33m{her}[0m husband and [1m[31m{his}[0m health . 
(12) [34m{Walt Rogers}[0m is back with us . 
(13) We 've been in and out now for almost two hours . 
(14) What 's happening with [34m{you}[0m and the 7th Cav as we continue to watch [34m{your}[0m image by way of video phone and the giant M1 - A1 tank . 
(15) [34m{Walt}[0m , good evening again .
