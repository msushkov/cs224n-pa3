(0) [3m[31m{An international team}[0m is developing [3m[34m{a vaccine against Alzheimer 's Disease}[0m and [3m[31m{they}[0m are trying [3m[34m{it}[0m out on a new and improved mouse model of the onus . 
(1) [1m[36m{Correspondent Jessica Berman}[0m explains . 
(2) Scientists working on [3m[34m{a vaccine against Alzheimer 's}[0m give a progress report this week in [33m{the journal Nature}[0m . 
(3) [3m[34m{The vaccine}[0m has only been tested in [1m[35m{mice that have been bred to have a form of Alzheimer 's Disease very similar to that of humans}[0m . 
(4) According to [35m{University of Toronto researcher David Westaway}[0m , [3m[35m{another team of scientists}[0m last year took the first step toward an [3m[33m{Alzheimer}[0m 's vaccine . 
(5) [3m[35m{That team}[0m [1m[34m{injected}[0m [34m{a small amount of amyloid protein , which accumulates in brains of Alzheimer 's patients}[0m and injected [34m{it}[0m in [1m[35m{the mice 's}[0m abdomens . 
(6) [1m[34m{The injection}[0m prompted [1m[35m{the animals '}[0m immune systems to kick in and clean up the amyloid deposits in [1m[35m{the rodents '}[0m brains . 
(7) But [1m[35m{those mice}[0m never [1m[32m{had}[0m any difficulties with learning and memory . 
(8) In [35m{Dr. Westaway 's}[0m view , [1m[32m{this}[0m made [3m[34m{the vaccine}[0m sort of pointless , since [1m[33m{learning and memory problems}[0m are a hallmark of [3m[33m{Alzheimer 's Disease}[0m . 
(9) So [35m{his}[0m research team decided to test a vaccine in [3m[36m{mice with Alzheimer 's more like that seen in many humans}[0m . 
(10) Now normally [3m[33m{Alzheimer 's Disease}[0m might have [1m[33m{this strong deficit in learning and memory , actually in our experiments the ability to navigate around a small tank of water using cues pinned up on the wall of the testing room}[0m , and once [3m[31m{we}[0m started immunizing [3m[36m{the mice}[0m against the [3m[33m{Alzheimer Disease}[0m peptides then the performance showed a dramatic improvement such as [3m[36m{they}[0m came very close to the performance of regular mice that have not been genetically engineered to resemble [3m[33m{Alzheimer 's Disease}[0m . 
(11) A second [3m[33m{Alzheimer}[0m 's vaccine experiment was also reported in [33m{the journal Nature}[0m by a group of University of South Florida scientists in Tampa . 
(12) In a third published paper [36m{researchers}[0m formally described how [36m{they}[0m genetically engineered a mouse model of [3m[33m{Alzheimer 's}[0m similar to the human disease , complete with memory and learning impairment . 
(13) Neuroscientist Paul Chapman of the Cardiff School of Bio-Sciences in Wales , wrote an article in [33m{the magazine}[0m commenting on the developments . 
(14) [4m[31m{We all}[0m know [4m[31m{we}[0m 've got a long way to go before [4m[31m{we}[0m have a cure for [3m[33m{Alzheimer 's Disease}[0m , but in order to get there [4m[31m{we}[0m need to have confidence that [4m[31m{we}[0m understand [3m[33m{the disease}[0m and that [4m[31m{we}[0m have what [4m[31m{we}[0m call a model system for predicting whether [3m[32m{these treatments}[0m will work . 
(15) And the fact that these papers are now showing [4m[31m{us}[0m that behaviorally these [1m[31m{models}[0m do what humans do , that is [1m[31m{they}[0m behave more poorly as [1m[31m{they}[0m age if [1m[31m{they}[0m have [3m[33m{Alzheimer 's}[0m genes , and that [3m[32m{these treatments}[0m can reverse that , it just means [4m[31m{we}[0m have that much more confidence [3m[32m{these treatments}[0m will work in humans . 
(16) In a related development an international team of researchers reports in the latest issue of the journal Science , that a genetic mutation in an area of chromosome ten may put some people at increased risk of late onset Alzheimer 's Disease , the most common form of dementia in the elderly .
