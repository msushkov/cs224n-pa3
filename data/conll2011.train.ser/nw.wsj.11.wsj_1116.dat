(0) [1m[32m{Your Oct. 2 editorial `` Reding , Wrighting & Erithmatic '' on the recent `` education summit ''}[0m was like most pieces on the subject of education : [1m[32m{It}[0m had little to say . 
(1) Oddly , though , on the very same page you printed [36m{a comment that addresses one of the most serious shortcomings of the American education system}[0m . 
(2) Unfortunately , [36m{the comment}[0m was buried in another article , so [36m{it}[0m could not stand out in an education context . 
(3) In the Manager 's Journal , Atsushi Kageyama , in commenting on many differences between American and Japanese culture , said , `` [1m[31m{Japanese children}[0m are raised in a way many Americans would find severe . 
(4) After a wonderfully frivolous early childhood , [1m[31m{they}[0m are exposed to rigid discipline as soon as [1m[31m{they}[0m enter school . '' 
(5) What far too many people concerned about education either fail to understand or choose to ignore is that American children , on the whole , are among the most undisciplined in the world , making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful . 
(6) Unless parents and educators alike start to develop more discipline in children , all the worthy concern , discussions and actions will not solve the problem . 
(7) Allen B. Richards Peterborough , N.H .
