(0) In [4m[34m{one of the first indoor air - pollution cases to go to trial}[0m , a state - court jury [31m{decided}[0m in favor of [35m{the defendant , Burlington Industries Inc}[0m . 
(1) [31m{The verdict , reached late last week in Cincinnati ,}[0m may end an eight - year legal battle for [35m{the Greensboro , N.C. , carpet maker}[0m . 
(2) [1m[32m{Glenn and Sharon Beebe of Cincinnati}[0m had sued [35m{the com - pany}[0m in 1981 after installing [35m{Burlington}[0m carpets in [1m[32m{their}[0m office . 
(3) [1m[32m{The Beebes}[0m alleged that toxic fumes from [3m[33m{the carpets}[0m made [1m[32m{them}[0m sick . 
(4) As a result of [1m[32m{their}[0m illness , [1m[32m{the Beebes}[0m said , [1m[32m{they}[0m lost $ 1.8 million in wages and earnings . 
(5) In addition , [1m[32m{they}[0m said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left [1m[32m{them}[0m sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances . 
(6) [4m[34m{The case}[0m had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over [32m{the so - called sick - building syndrome}[0m . 
(7) Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside . 
(8) [4m[31m{Anthony J. Iaciofano , a lawyer for Burlington ,}[0m said [35m{the company}[0m believes [1m[32m{the Beebes '}[0m symptoms were not related to [3m[33m{the carpeting}[0m . 
(9) [4m[31m{He}[0m said that [3m[31m{ill effects from new carpets}[0m manifest [3m[31m{themselves}[0m immediately but that [1m[32m{the Beebes '}[0m symptoms appeared months later . 
(10) [1m[36m{Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer ,}[0m said [31m{the verdict}[0m would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . 
(11) Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes [32m{sick - building syndrome}[0m and much of that research was unavailable when [1m[32m{the Beebes}[0m filed [4m[34m{the case}[0m , [1m[36m{she}[0m said . 
(12) [1m[32m{The Beebes}[0m now believe that a prime culprit for [1m[32m{their}[0m injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in [3m[33m{the carpeting}[0m . 
(13) But [1m[32m{the Beebes}[0m did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in [4m[34m{the case}[0m , [1m[36m{Ms. Adams}[0m said . 
(14) [1m[32m{The Beebes}[0m have not yet decided whether to appeal . 
(15) TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt setback . 
(16) [1m[34m{The Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court}[0m dismissed six lawsuits attempting to block [4m[32m{a $ 2.5 billion project planned for 42nd Street in Manhattan}[0m . 
(17) Opponents of [4m[32m{the project}[0m had claimed that the city and the state of New York , which are co-sponsoring [4m[32m{the project}[0m , had failed to adhere to environmental guidelines . 
(18) All but [4m[32m{two}[0m of the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed since [4m[32m{the project 's}[0m 1984 approval have been dismissed before the trial stage . 
(19) [4m[32m{The two that remain}[0m have n't yet reached the pre-trial fact - finding stage . 
(20) State officials said [1m[34m{the court 's}[0m ruling clears the way for proceedings to condemn buildings in [4m[33m{the area}[0m . 
(21) `` [4m[32m{This project}[0m is ready to move , '' said State Urban Development Corp. Chairman Vincent Tese . 
(22) But [1m[35m{developers of four planned office towers}[0m cautioned that obstacles still remain . 
(23) As part of the agreement with the state , [1m[35m{the developers -- a partnership of Park Tower Realty and Prudential Insurance Co. of America --}[0m said [1m[35m{they}[0m would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was `` significant litigation '' pending . 
(24) [4m[35m{Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer}[0m said [1m[35m{the development team}[0m will have to review two additional lawsuits before putting up a $ 155 million letter of credit to cover condemnation costs . 
(25) Also , [4m[35m{he}[0m said , [1m[35m{the partnership}[0m is waiting to see whether [1m[34m{the appellate division 's}[0m ruling will be appealed . 
(26) The plan , which has been plagued with delays and business - related setbacks , seeks to transform [4m[33m{the area}[0m from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district . 
(27) State and city officials are still negotiating with developers to renovate historic theaters and build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel . 
(28) [33m{FEDERAL JUDGE}[0m EXPANDS role of U.S. courts in extradition decisions . 
(29) [33m{U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn , N.Y. ,}[0m [1m[33m{ruled}[0m that [4m[34m{a man implicated in an attack on an Israeli passenger bus in 1986}[0m can be extradited to Israel for trial . 
(30) A magistrate had initially refused the request , ruling that [4m[31m{the attack}[0m had been a political act for which [4m[34m{the man , Mahmoud El - Abed Ahmad ,}[0m would be exempt from extradition . 
(31) However , [33m{Judge Weinstein}[0m wrote in [33m{his}[0m opinion late last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians can not be defined as political acts . 
(32) [33m{Judge Weinstein}[0m also ruled that judges must consider prior to extradition whether the defendant will be treated fairly in a foreign court . 
(33) To do so , [33m{the judge}[0m said , the U.S. courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of [36m{the State Department 's}[0m assessment . 
(34) [33m{He}[0m said that in [3m[36m{this case}[0m [33m{he}[0m concurred with [36m{the State Department 's}[0m decision that [4m[34m{Mr. Ahmad}[0m should be extradited . 
(35) [4m[34m{Mr. Ahmad 's}[0m lawyer said [3m[32m{he}[0m would appeal . 
(36) [1m[31m{Lawyers close to the case}[0m said [1m[31m{they}[0m believed [1m[33m{the ruling}[0m was unprecedented . 
(37) `` Up until now [32m{the courts}[0m have said it is not [32m{their}[0m role to supervise the foreign country 's courts , '' said Jacques Semmelman , the assistant U.S. attorney on [3m[36m{the case}[0m . 
(38) [4m[36m{FORMER CANADIAN AMBASSADOR to the U.S. Allan E. Gotlieb}[0m has joined [3m[34m{the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper , Hamilton & Scheetz}[0m as a consultant . 
(39) [4m[36m{Mr. Gotlieb , who serves as a consultant to Stikeman , Elliott , one of Canada 's biggest law firms ,}[0m is advising [3m[34m{Pepper Hamilton 's}[0m Washington office on legal matters related to Canadian - U.S. investment , corporate finance and international transactions . 
(40) QUOTABLE : 
(41) In a speech prepared for delivery in New York yesterday , [31m{retired Justice Lewis Powell}[0m contested the notion that the last [4m[36m{Supreme Court}[0m term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously [4m[33m{proclaimed}[0m a ` shift in direction ' on [4m[36m{the court}[0m ... . 
(42) [31m{I}[0m take [4m[33m{these pronouncements}[0m , like many that have preceded [4m[33m{them}[0m in past years , with a grain of salt . 
(43) In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .
