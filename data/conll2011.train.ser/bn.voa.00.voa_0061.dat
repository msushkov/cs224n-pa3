(0) And at one forty - five Universal time you are listening to [3m[31m{the Voice of America}[0m . 
(1) [3m[32m{Monkey experiments by an international research team}[0m have reversed the brain degeneration typical of [1m[34m{Parkinson 's Disease}[0m by placing repair proteins inside [1m[36m{a disabled AIDS virus}[0m . 
(2) As [3m[31m{we}[0m hear from [3m[34m{David McAlary}[0m , [3m[32m{the work}[0m is being hailed as a breakthrough in an effort to end [1m[34m{Parkinson 's}[0m deterioration . 
(3) [4m[35m{Patients with advanced Parkinson 's}[0m are easy to spot . 
(4) Degeneration of brain cells or neurons causes [4m[35m{them}[0m to shake , shuffle and stoop . 
(5) [33m{The neurons}[0m produce less and less of the chemical dopamine that helps relay signals between [33m{them}[0m . 
(6) [1m[31m{Dopamine replacement with drugs}[0m is the main therapy but [1m[31m{it}[0m loses effectiveness as [1m[34m{the disease}[0m progresses . 
(7) [1m[32m{The next step}[0m is transplanting nerve tissue from a fetus to replace the lost dopamine neurons , but [1m[32m{that}[0m is a costly , risky surgery . 
(8) Now [4m[36m{a US - Swiss - French group}[0m has successfully tested [32m{a third approach}[0m in [3m[35m{monkeys}[0m , [32m{one that delivers the seeds of a dopamine neuron nourishment protein directly to the brain by injection}[0m . 
(9) [36m{It}[0m works as a protectant of the cell so to stop [1m[34m{the disease}[0m in [1m[34m{its}[0m tracks . 
(10) [1m[35m{This}[0m is study leader Jeffery Codover of Rush Presbyterian St. Lukes Medical Center in Chicago . 
(11) [36m{The stimulating brain protein his team used}[0m is called GDNF . 
(12) Previous studies have shown that [36m{GDNF}[0m keeps dopamine cells healthy but the problem has been getting [36m{it}[0m to the brain . 
(13) As a defense , the brain 's blood vessels [4m[33m{prevent}[0m most compounds from entering from the blood stream making it difficult to design a [1m[34m{Parkinson}[0m 's drug . 
(14) To overcome [4m[33m{this}[0m , [1m[35m{Mr. Codover 's}[0m team injected [34m{a gene to make GDNF}[0m right into [3m[35m{the monkey 's}[0m brains . 
(15) To transport [34m{the gene}[0m , [1m[33m{Louisiane University researchers}[0m devised [1m[36m{an HIV virus stripped of its infecting machinery}[0m . 
(16) When [1m[33m{they}[0m injected [1m[36m{the altered virus}[0m into brains of [3m[36m{aging animals with early Parkinson 's}[0m [1m[36m{it}[0m conveyed [34m{the attached GDNF gene}[0m efficiently , causing dopamine cells to produce [36m{the rescue protein}[0m on site . 
(17) When [1m[33m{we}[0m delivered [36m{GDNF}[0m via [4m[34m{gene therapy}[0m in [3m[36m{these aged monkeys}[0m [1m[33m{we}[0m were able to completely reverse [3m[33m{all the cellular changes , degenerative changes that are seen in aged monkeys as they relate to Parkinson 's Disease}[0m . 
(18) [1m[33m{The researchers}[0m report in the journal Science that [4m[34m{the gene therapy}[0m also restored coordinated movement in young monkeys in which [1m[34m{Parkinson 's}[0m was chemically induced . 
(19) The benefits of [4m[34m{the treatment}[0m appear permanent or at least very long - lasting as [36m{GDNF}[0m genes continually produce [36m{the rescue protein}[0m . 
(20) [1m[35m{Mr. Codover}[0m says that in people , [4m[34m{it}[0m would be tested as preventive therapy rather than [35m{one for existing symptoms}[0m . 
(21) Most current clinical trials in [1m[34m{Parkinson 's Disease}[0m are directed towards [35m{symptomatic therapy}[0m or towards more advanced patients . 
(22) This type of therapy is directed towards more early patients with the emphasis on preventing the progression of [1m[34m{the disease}[0m rather than replacing lost neurons or more symptomatic types of benefits . 
(23) In Stockholm , [4m[32m{Sweden Carolinska Institute neuroscientist Lars Olson}[0m says if [31m{gene delivery}[0m works well in people , [31m{it}[0m would be the best [1m[34m{Parkinson 's}[0m treatment yet . 
(24) [31m{It}[0m would be better because you would n't have to take medication and you would n't have to do cell transplantation either . 
(25) [31m{It}[0m might be a treatment that you would have to do only once or perhaps a few times during life with [1m[34m{the illness}[0m . 
(26) [4m[32m{Mr. Olson}[0m says [31m{the treatment}[0m might also be applied to other brain diseases in which nerve cells degenerate , but [4m[32m{he}[0m warns of a major hurdle in assuring patients get the proper dose of gene therapy because too much is bad . 
(27) If you over - stimulate other neighboring dopamine neurons you might get side effects similar to some of the symptoms seen in schizophrenia for instance . 
(28) For use in patients one would like to have a system where the activity of the delivered gene could be controlled . 
(29) [1m[35m{Jeffery Cooover}[0m says [1m[35m{he}[0m is now testing ways of regulating gene delivery in monkeys . 
(30) [1m[35m{He}[0m hopes to try [4m[34m{the procedure}[0m in people within five years following US government review . 
(31) [3m[34m{David McAlary}[0m , [3m[31m{VOA News}[0m , Washington .
