(0) In [3m[34m{Yugoslavia}[0m today , a [1m[36m{Belgrade}[0m court indited [36m{six members of electoral commissions}[0m on charges that [36m{they}[0m abused [36m{their}[0m official functions . 
(1) [4m[33m{Last September}[0m , [3m[34m{Yugoslavia 's}[0m Federal Election Commission published [4m[34m{results of a presidential vote , results which , if anyone had believed them , would have necessitated a run off between Slobodan Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica}[0m . 
(2) There was no run off , of course , Serbs would n't stand for [3m[33m{it}[0m . 
(3) Now three months later [4m[31m{Kostunica}[0m is no longer opposing [3m[34m{the government}[0m . 
(4) [4m[31m{He}[0m is running [3m[34m{it}[0m . 
(5) [1m[35m{The World 's}[0m Jackie Rolan reports from [1m[36m{Belgrade}[0m . 
(6) The popular uprising which swept [4m[31m{Vojislav Kostunica}[0m to power , hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in early October to force [35m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m to accept [35m{his}[0m election defeat and step down . 
(7) In the two months since then the United Nations and Western governments have rushed to welcome [3m[34m{Yugoslavia}[0m back into the international fold , but at home the most noticeable change has been [3m[36m{a sharp increase in the cost of living}[0m . 
(8) [4m[31m{President Kostunica}[0m says [3m[36m{this}[0m is inevitable but [4m[31m{he}[0m sees better times ahead . 
(9) We are living all under very difficult conditions . 
(10) Social aspirations [1m[32m{is}[0m very difficult and [1m[32m{that}[0m is something which has to do with [35m{Milosevic}[0m regime , sanctions of international community , bombing of [3m[34m{this country}[0m last year , but what people mostly appreciate is that sense of freedom . 
(11) The West has been rewarding the democratic reforms in [4m[35m{Serbia}[0m with big aid packages , but the money comes with some conditions attached . 
(12) Western governments want [4m[35m{Serbia}[0m to [3m[31m{cooperate}[0m with [4m[32m{the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague}[0m . 
(13) [4m[32m{The Tribunal}[0m has been allowed to open an office in [1m[36m{Belgrade}[0m , but it 's not clear how far [3m[31m{this cooperation}[0m will go . 
(14) [4m[31m{President Kostunica}[0m says [4m[31m{he}[0m does not agree with demands that [35m{Milosevic}[0m should be [1m[34m{extradited}[0m to [31m{The Hague}[0m . 
(15) [4m[31m{I}[0m am not in favor of [1m[34m{that}[0m [4m[31m{I}[0m must say . 
(16) [4m[31m{I}[0m am in favor of trying to go through these processes of responsibility within [3m[34m{the country}[0m . 
(17) [4m[31m{I}[0m have a very general and many very general objections to [4m[32m{the Hague Tribunal}[0m . 
(18) [4m[31m{I}[0m can not imagine that just one judicial instant , just one court is actually enough to cope this problems . 
(19) After winning the presidency in [4m[33m{September}[0m , [3m[32m{Kostunica and his allies}[0m now face a much easier task with [1m[33m{Serbian parliamentary elections}[0m in less then two weeks time . 
(20) The latest opinion polls suggest [3m[32m{they}[0m will get about 65 % of the vote , while [35m{Milosevic}[0m and [35m{his}[0m party would be lucky to win more then a few seats . 
(21) [1m[31m{The opposition coalition}[0m has been an alliance of convenience and [4m[31m{President Kostunica}[0m admits that [1m[31m{it}[0m will not last long beyond [1m[33m{the elections}[0m . 
(22) [1m[31m{We}[0m had to run through [1m[33m{these republic elections}[0m and with [3m[35m{all these differences}[0m [1m[31m{we}[0m are staying till [1m[33m{these elections}[0m , and later on when [1m[31m{we}[0m come to some elections , of course , quite normally and for the good of democracy , [3m[35m{these differences between the parties within Democratic Opposition of Serbia}[0m will appear . 
(23) [3m[35m{The splits}[0m are already visible with public disagreements between [4m[31m{Kostunica}[0m and Zoran Djindjic , the man expected to form [4m[35m{the new Serbian government}[0m , so [3m[34m{the country}[0m faces more political instability in the year ahead and the likely prospect of new elections . 
(24) For [1m[35m{The World}[0m , [4m[36m{I}[0m am Jacky Rowland in [1m[36m{Belgrade}[0m .
