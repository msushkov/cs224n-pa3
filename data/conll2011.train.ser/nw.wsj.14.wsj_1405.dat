(0) With the dust settling from [3m[31m{the failed coup attempt in Panama}[0m , one of the many lingering questions [1m[34m{the Bush administration}[0m will ponder is this : Is [4m[35m{the National Security Council staff}[0m big enough , and does [33m{it}[0m have enough clout , to do [33m{its}[0m job of coordinating foreign policy ? 
(1) [1m[31m{President Bush 's}[0m national security adviser , Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft , came into office in January intent on making [4m[35m{the NSC staff}[0m leaner and more disciplined than [4m[35m{it}[0m had been during the [1m[33m{Reagan}[0m administration . 
(2) [3m[33m{Gen. Scowcroft}[0m was a member of [3m[34m{the Tower Commission , which investigated the Iran - Contra affair}[0m . 
(3) [3m[33m{He}[0m was all too aware of how [4m[35m{a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff}[0m had spun out of control and nearly wrecked [1m[33m{President Reagan 's}[0m second term . 
(4) So , following both the style [3m[33m{he}[0m pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of [3m[34m{the Tower Commission}[0m , [3m[33m{Gen. Scowcroft}[0m has pruned [4m[35m{the NSC staff}[0m and tried to ensure that [4m[35m{it}[0m sticks to [4m[35m{its}[0m assigned tasks -- namely , gathering [1m[35m{the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community}[0m ; serving as an honest broker in distilling [1m[35m{that information}[0m for [3m[36m{the president}[0m and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out . 
(5) [3m[34m{The Tower Commission}[0m specifically said that [4m[35m{the NSC staff}[0m should be `` small '' and warned against letting [1m[36m{`` energetic self - starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North}[0m strike out on [1m[36m{their}[0m own rather than leaving the day - to - day execution of policies to [32m{the State Department}[0m , [4m[34m{Pentagon}[0m or [4m[33m{Central Intelligence Agency}[0m . 
(6) However , [3m[31m{the Panama episode}[0m has raised questions about whether [4m[35m{the NSC staff}[0m is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues . 
(7) During [3m[31m{the coup attempt}[0m and [3m[31m{its}[0m aftermath , [33m{NSC}[0m staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says [3m[32m{one senior administration official}[0m . 
(8) `` [33m{It}[0m 's a very small shop . '' 
(9) [3m[33m{Gen. Scowcroft}[0m does n't plan to [3m[32m{increase}[0m [4m[35m{the staff}[0m right now , but is weighing [3m[32m{that possibility}[0m , [3m[32m{the official}[0m adds . 
(10) [4m[35m{The NSC staff}[0m `` does n't have the horsepower that [35m{I}[0m believe is required to have an effective interagency process , '' says [35m{Frank Gaffney , a former Pentagon aide who now runs the Center for Security Policy , a conservative Washington think - tank}[0m . 
(11) `` The problem with [1m[34m{this administration}[0m , [35m{I}[0m think , is that by design [1m[34m{it}[0m has greatly diminished , both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense , the role of [33m{the NSC}[0m . '' 
(12) [33m{The National Security Council itself}[0m was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between [3m[36m{the president}[0m and [32m{the State Department}[0m , [4m[34m{Pentagon}[0m and intelligence agencies . 
(13) By law , [33m{the council}[0m includes [3m[36m{the president}[0m , vice president and secretaries of state and defense . 
(14) In practice , the director of [4m[33m{central intelligence}[0m and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members . 
(15) But the size , shape and role of [4m[35m{the NSC staff}[0m have been left for [1m[32m{each president}[0m and [1m[32m{his}[0m national security adviser to [31m{decide}[0m . 
(16) [31m{That task}[0m is one of [4m[31m{Washington 's}[0m perennial problems . 
(17) In the [1m[31m{Bush}[0m White House , the size of the [33m{NSC}[0m 's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987 , administration officials say . 
(18) Administration officials insist that the size of [4m[35m{the staff}[0m was n't a problem during [3m[31m{the Panama crisis}[0m . 
(19) But one clear problem during [3m[31m{the coup attempt}[0m was that [3m[31m{the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America , Everett Briggs ,}[0m was gone . 
(20) [3m[31m{He}[0m had just resigned , at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over [1m[34m{the administration 's}[0m policy on [36m{Panama}[0m and support for Nicaragua 's [3m[35m{Contra}[0m rebels . 
(21) The absence of [3m[31m{Mr. Briggs}[0m underscored the possible inadequacy of the current [33m{NSC}[0m staff . 
(22) [4m[32m{Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy , Robert Gates ,}[0m are experts in U.S. - Soviet affairs . 
(23) [3m[33m{Gen. Scowcroft}[0m is particularly well - versed in arms control , and [34m{Mr. Gates}[0m has spent years studying Soviet politics and society . 
(24) [4m[32m{Both}[0m have become confidants of [1m[31m{President Bush}[0m . 
(25) But neither has an extensive background in [3m[33m{Latin America}[0m , the Middle East or Asia . 
(26) In [4m[36m{those areas}[0m , the role of [33m{NSC}[0m staffers under [4m[32m{them}[0m therefore have become more important . 
(27) [3m[33m{Gen. Scowcroft}[0m knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers [3m[33m{he}[0m faces is that [33m{NSC}[0m staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy - making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced [32m{State Department}[0m and [4m[34m{Pentagon}[0m bureaus . 
(28) But just as every previous [33m{NSC}[0m adviser has , [3m[33m{Gen. Scowcroft}[0m now will have to mull at what point [4m[35m{the NSC staff}[0m becomes too lean and too restrained .
