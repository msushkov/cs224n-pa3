(0) [4m[32m{Time Warner Inc.}[0m is considering [33m{a legal challenge to Tele - Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. , a move that could lead to all - out war between the cable industry 's two most powerful players}[0m . 
(1) [4m[32m{Time}[0m is also fighting [3m[36m{the transaction}[0m on other fronts , by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining [32m{Tele - Communications}[0m as investors in [3m[34m{Showtime}[0m , cable - TV industry executives say . 
(2) [4m[32m{Time}[0m officials declined to comment . 
(3) Last week , [32m{Tele - Communications}[0m agreed to pay [4m[35m{Viacom Inc.}[0m $ 225 million for [3m[31m{a 50 % stake in its Showtime subsidiary , which is a distant second to Time 's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay - TV networks to cable subscribers}[0m . 
(4) [32m{Tele - Communications , the U.S. 's largest cable company ,}[0m said [32m{it}[0m may seek other cable partners to join in [32m{its}[0m investment . 
(5) [32m{Tele - Communications}[0m is [36m{HBO 's}[0m largest customer , and [3m[33m{the two}[0m have a number of other business relationships . 
(6) Earlier this year , [4m[32m{Time}[0m even discussed bringing [32m{Tele - Communications}[0m in as an investor in [36m{HBO}[0m , executives at [3m[33m{both companies}[0m said . 
(7) The purchase of the [3m[34m{Showtime}[0m stake is `` a direct slap in our face , '' said one senior [4m[32m{Time}[0m executive . 
(8) [4m[32m{Time}[0m is expected to mount [33m{a legal challenge}[0m in U.S. District Court in New York , where [4m[35m{Viacom}[0m in May filed [4m[34m{a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay - TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime}[0m . 
(9) [35m{Executives involved in plotting Time 's defense}[0m say [4m[32m{it}[0m is now preparing a countersuit naming both [4m[35m{Viacom}[0m and [32m{Tele - Communications}[0m as defendants . 
(10) [35m{The executives}[0m say [4m[32m{Time}[0m may seek to break up the [3m[36m{transaction}[0m after [3m[36m{it}[0m is consummated , or may seek constraints that would prevent [32m{Tele - Communications}[0m from dropping [36m{HBO}[0m in any of [32m{its}[0m cable systems in favor of [3m[34m{Showtime}[0m . 
(11) [4m[35m{Viacom}[0m officials declined to comment . 
(12) [31m{Jerome Kern , Tele - Communications ' chief outside counsel ,}[0m said [31m{he}[0m was n't aware of [4m[32m{Time 's}[0m legal plans . 
(13) But [31m{he}[0m said that any effort by [4m[32m{Time}[0m to characterize [32m{the Tele - Communications}[0m investment in [3m[34m{Showtime}[0m as anti-competitive would be `` the pot calling the kettle black . '' 
(14) `` It 's hard to see how an investment by [32m{the largest -LCB- cable operator -RCB-}[0m in [3m[34m{the weaker of the two networks}[0m is anti-competitive , when [36m{the stronger of the two networks}[0m is owned by [4m[32m{the second largest '' cable operator}[0m , [31m{Mr. Kern}[0m said . 
(15) In addition to owning [36m{HBO}[0m , with 22 million subscribers , [4m[32m{Time Warner}[0m separately operates cable - TV system serving about 5.6 million cable - TV subscribers . 
(16) [32m{Tele - Communications}[0m controls close to 12 million cable subscribers , and [4m[35m{Viacom}[0m has about one million . 
(17) In [4m[35m{its}[0m suit against [4m[32m{Time}[0m , [4m[35m{Viacom}[0m says the ownership of both cable systems and cable - programming networks gives [4m[32m{the company}[0m too much market power . 
(18) [4m[32m{Time}[0m argues that in joining up with [32m{Tele - Communications}[0m , [4m[35m{Viacom}[0m has potentially more power , particularly since [4m[35m{Viacom}[0m also owns cable networks MTV , VH - 1 and Nick at Nite . 
(19) Ironically , [4m[33m{Tele - Communications and Time}[0m have often worked closely in the cable business . 
(20) Together , [4m[33m{they}[0m control nearly 40 % of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. ; [32m{Tele - Communications}[0m has a 21.8 % stake , while [4m[32m{Time Warner}[0m has a 17.8 % stake . 
(21) But since [4m[32m{Time 's}[0m merger with Warner Communications Inc. , relations between [4m[33m{the two}[0m have become strained . 
(22) Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated . 
(23) Meanwhile , some legal observers say [1m[31m{the Tele - Communications investment}[0m and other developments are weakening [4m[35m{Viacom 's}[0m antitrust suit against [4m[32m{Time}[0m . 
(24) [4m[35m{Viacom}[0m accuses [4m[32m{Time}[0m in [4m[35m{its}[0m suit of refusing to carry [3m[34m{Showtime}[0m or a service , The Movie Channel , on [4m[36m{Time 's Manhattan Cable TV system , one of the nation 's largest urban systems}[0m . 
(25) But [3m[35m{yesterday}[0m , [4m[36m{Manhattan Cable}[0m announced [4m[36m{it}[0m will launch [3m[34m{Showtime}[0m on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers . 
(26) [3m[34m{Showtime}[0m has also accused [36m{HBO}[0m of locking up the lion 's share of [4m[31m{Hollywood 's}[0m movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios . 
(27) But [3m[34m{Showtime}[0m has continued to sign new contracts with [4m[31m{Hollywood}[0m studios , and [3m[35m{yesterday}[0m announced [3m[34m{it}[0m will buy movies from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with [36m{HBO}[0m .
