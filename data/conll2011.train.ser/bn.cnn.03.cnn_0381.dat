(0) [3m[36m{Martha Stewart}[0m is one of those stories that is in the news big time again . 
(1) [3m[36m{She}[0m resigned as Chairman and CEO of Martha Stewart Living , Omnimedia , the company that bears [3m[36m{her}[0m name , after pleading not guilty to a laundry list of charges brought by [4m[31m{the Justice Department and the SEC}[0m , insider trading , obstruction of justice , conspiracy to hide what [4m[31m{they}[0m say is an illegal stock sale , we 're talking about 4,000 shares of stock that netted [3m[36m{her}[0m about $ 225,000 . 
(2) How does this compare with other corporate scandals ? 
(3) [4m[32m{Enron}[0m 's bankruptcy cost [3m[32m{thousands of people}[0m [3m[32m{their}[0m jobs and [3m[32m{their}[0m life savings and Kenny Lay and the chairman and president , both of [4m[32m{that company}[0m remain unindicted . 
(4) The chief financial officer is the only one there taking the fall . 
(5) WorldCom once employed 80,000 people and went broke on the largest corporate bankruptcy in the United States . 
(6) [3m[33m{Bernie Evers}[0m is living [3m[33m{his}[0m life and unindicted . 
(7) The CEO took the fall there . 
(8) [3m[31m{Tyco 's CEO and President}[0m [3m[31m{Dennis Kozlowski}[0m and the last time [3m[35m{I}[0m looked , [3m[31m{he}[0m was sailing around Martha Vinyard on [3m[31m{his}[0m yacht . 
(9) At the time , [3m[36m{Martha Stewart}[0m was worth in the neighborhood of $ 1 billion , so you could make the argument [3m[36m{she}[0m might have been guilty of stupidity . 
(10) But the question Is [3m[36m{she}[0m being unfairly singled out for prosecution ? 
(11) The e-mail address is am@cnn.com. and [3m[35m{I}[0m 'm sure [3m[34m{we}[0m 'll hear from many of you and [3m[34m{we}[0m will select [4m[33m{some of the responses}[0m and share [4m[33m{them}[0m with you a bit later . 
(12) What makes something worth a billion dollars have to grab the phone after losing two grand with a falling stock price ? 
(13) It could be arrogance or factors of being [3m[36m{a powerful woman}[0m and the celebrity --
