(0) Now `` [4m[31m{The Truth Squad , '' a reality check on the candidates}[0m . 
(1) In all our polling , Americans have rated education as the number one issue in this election . 
(2) [1m[33m{This year}[0m , [1m[36m{the federal government}[0m is spending [34m{nearly $ 123 billion}[0m on education . 
(3) [34m{That}[0m 's $ 60 billion more than ten years ago . 
(4) [34m{That}[0m 's still a small fraction of the total spent . 
(5) Nonetheless , [4m[35m{many of the other schools}[0m are in trouble . 
(6) So what would [1m[32m{Gore}[0m and [3m[33m{Bush}[0m do to fix [4m[35m{them}[0m ? 
(7) Are [31m{their}[0m plans realistic ? 
(8) [4m[36m{NBC 's}[0m Lisa Myers and [4m[31m{`` The Truth Squad ''}[0m with some answers tonight , `` in depth . '' 
(9) [3m[33m{George Bush}[0m on the problem of education in [1m[36m{this country}[0m -- 
(10) [1m[36m{America}[0m today is in the midst of [35m{an education recession that can threaten our very future}[0m . 
(11) [35m{A recession ?}[0m 
(12) Experts say that term 's an exaggeration . 
(13) It 's true that the gap in test scores between white and minority students has grown , but experts say overall student performance has not declined . 
(14) To say there 's been a recession implies that [1m[34m{scores}[0m are going down , and there are n't any test scores going down . 
(15) At worst , [1m[34m{they}[0m 've been flat . 
(16) At worst , [1m[34m{they}[0m 've been flat . 
(17) [31m{Both candidates}[0m have a laundry list of proposals to improve education . 
(18) At the top of [1m[32m{Gore 's}[0m -- [3m[35m{a tax break to help families pay for college}[0m . 
(19) [1m[32m{I}[0m want to give new choices to [36m{parents}[0m to send [36m{their}[0m kids to college with [3m[35m{a $ 10,000 tax deduction for college tuition , per child , per year}[0m . 
(20) Experts say [3m[35m{this}[0m is less generous than [3m[35m{it}[0m sounds . 
(21) First , [1m[32m{Gore 's}[0m deduction is limited to $ 10,000 per family , not per child , as [1m[32m{he}[0m said . 
(22) What 's more , [1m[32m{his}[0m plan merely would modestly expand an existing tuition credit . 
(23) The bottom line for your family ? 
(24) The most that [3m[35m{this credit}[0m could give [4m[32m{any family}[0m is $ 800 more than what [4m[32m{they}[0m get under present law . 
(25) Another key issue [1m[33m{this year}[0m -- how to deal with failing public schools . 
(26) One of [3m[33m{Bush 's}[0m solutions -- double the number of independent , publicly funded schools , known as charter schools . 
(27) [4m[33m{We}[0m encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools . 
(28) [4m[33m{We}[0m 've got a strong charter school movement that [3m[33m{I}[0m signed the legislation to get started in [3m[31m{the state of Texas}[0m . 
(29) But experts say the early record of charter schools in [3m[31m{Texas}[0m is not as strong as [3m[33m{Bush}[0m claims . 
(30) Some schools , like Houston 's KIPP Academy , are said to be doing a great job with economically disadvantaged students , but a report finds that charter schools overall in [3m[31m{Texas}[0m have more students per teacher , less experienced teachers and lower test scores . 
(31) It 's a mixed picture . 
(32) Charter schools are having some successes and some struggles . 
(33) But overall , students in charter schools have lower performance scores than students in traditional public schools . 
(34) So how would [1m[32m{Gore}[0m deal with failing public schools ? 
(35) If [1m[31m{it}[0m 's a failing school , shut [1m[31m{it}[0m down , and reopen [1m[31m{it}[0m under a new principal , with a turnaround team of specialists [1m[35m{the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina}[0m . 
(36) But [3m[36m{Governor Hunt 's}[0m office says no school has been shut down yet in [3m[36m{his}[0m state . 
(37) So experts say it 's too soon to tell if [1m[35m{it}[0m works , and [3m[34m{some}[0m call [1m[32m{Gore 's}[0m plan an empty promise . 
(38) Why ? 
(39) Because [3m[34m{they}[0m say [1m[32m{Gore}[0m does not require the kind of annual student testing needed to tell whether a school is failing or not . 
(40) There 's simply not as much there as [1m[32m{Vice President Gore}[0m is pretending that there is . 
(41) It 's really more rhetoric than substance . 
(42) Most misleading of all , experts say , is [3m[32m{each candidate 's}[0m claim that [3m[32m{his}[0m plan can dramatically improve public education . 
(43) Because federal money accounts for only 7 % of school funding , experts say any President can help only at the margins . 
(44) [33m{Lisa Myers}[0m , [4m[36m{NBC News}[0m , Washington .
