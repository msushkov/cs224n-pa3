(0) And [3m[31m{we}[0m continue [1m[31m{tonight}[0m to try to measure just how [1m[33m{this story}[0m is playing overseas as [3m[31m{we}[0m 'll be doing each night all week . 
(1) [1m[31m{Tonight}[0m , [1m[36m{the anchor of the Israeli network evening newscast on Channel 2 Jerusalem Jacob Elon}[0m on what [3m[32m{Israelis}[0m are thinking and saying about [1m[34m{America 's}[0m long wait for a President - elect . 
(2) Frankly , [3m[32m{we}[0m are shocked here . 
(3) [3m[32m{We}[0m are used to [35m{the Israeli political system , always tied and always tied up}[0m , and election nights here too close to call more often than not , but what you 're experiencing over there is really inconceivable to [3m[32m{Israelis}[0m . 
(4) They spend a lot of air time here trying to convey [36m{the electoral system}[0m to [1m[36m{my}[0m viewers here , and the election action [1m[36m{I}[0m got was basically Hey , [36m{this}[0m is undemocratic . 
(5) [1m[34m{This}[0m is the greatest democracy we 're talking about , and [36m{the system}[0m is undemocratic , and the turnout as well [1m[36m{I}[0m felt 's over 90 % here usually , and it 's hard for Israeli citizens to grasp 50 % . 
(6) Since we 're talking about Israeli reel and the Middle East , [1m[33m{it}[0m 's not , you know , the major headline [3m[34m{every day}[0m , but [1m[33m{it}[0m certainly was a major story . 
(7) On the election day , [1m[35m{we}[0m had hours and hours of broadcast here live , same as in [1m[34m{the States}[0m , and [1m[35m{we}[0m 've been following [1m[33m{this story}[0m , of course , [3m[34m{every day}[0m , but here as usual , [1m[36m{I}[0m might say , [1m[35m{we}[0m have news of [1m[35m{our}[0m own . 
(8) Actually today , we just had four Israelis killed in three separate terrorist acts . 
(9) The peace forces do n't like uncertainty , [1m[36m{I}[0m would say even less than the stock market , and things here are getting worse day by day . 
(10) [1m[32m{Israel}[0m is usually looking up to [4m[32m{the President of the United States}[0m for some help . 
(11) Some Israelis at least , if not most of [3m[32m{them}[0m , are still hoping that [4m[32m{President Clinton}[0m might be able to intervene and help in the short time [4m[32m{he}[0m has left , but the more things are complicated and uncertain back there in [1m[34m{the States}[0m , [1m[36m{I}[0m think more and more Israelis are worried that there 's nobody to turn to , and [1m[36m{I}[0m think what happened in the past few days among Israelis here is a new perception that maybe [3m[33m{things in the United States}[0m are not as perfect as they might have thought . 
(12) Actually , [3m[33m{they}[0m 're far from being perfect , and [3m[33m{they}[0m are sounding and looking to [3m[32m{us here}[0m more and more like what [3m[32m{we}[0m know from [3m[32m{our}[0m own political system . 
(13) That insight [1m[31m{tonight}[0m from [1m[36m{Jacob Eilon , the anchorman Israel 's Channel 2 network news}[0m . 
(14) [1m[36m{He}[0m took time out from covering the death of [3m[36m{Lea Rabin , widow of Yitzhak Rabin}[0m . 
(15) [3m[36m{She}[0m died yesterday of cancer at the age of 72 .
