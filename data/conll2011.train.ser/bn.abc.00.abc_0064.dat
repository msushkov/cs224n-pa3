(0) In [36m{Washington}[0m [31m{this}[0m was a day about beginnings , but [31m{it}[0m 's also one of farewells . 
(1) [4m[31m{Bill Clinton}[0m said good-bye . 
(2) Few people can really know what it must be like to leave [1m[31m{the White House}[0m as President that final time . 
(3) We do know that [4m[31m{Mr. Clinton}[0m worked right up until [34m{the end}[0m , granting [4m[33m{more than 100 pardons}[0m as [4m[31m{he}[0m walked out the door . 
(4) Here 's ABC 's John Cochran . 
(5) 7777 
(6) An hour after seeing [4m[35m{George W. Bush}[0m sworn in , [4m[31m{Bill Clinton}[0m for the first time in 8 years was no longer introduced as the President of the United States . 
(7) It is , indeed , my great honor and privilege to introduce to you now [4m[35m{our President of the United States}[0m . 
(8) Cheers 
(9) This was the farewell from [4m[31m{his}[0m [36m{Washington}[0m friends . 
(10) Many had served in [4m[31m{his}[0m government . 
(11) [1m[32m{Many of them}[0m are not sure what the future holds for [1m[32m{them}[0m . 
(12) You know how it is when you leave [1m[31m{the White House}[0m , you wonder if you 'll draw a crowd again . 
(13) [4m[31m{The President}[0m told [1m[33m{supporters}[0m [1m[33m{they}[0m should be proud of what [4m[31m{his}[0m administration had accomplished . 
(14) [1m[33m{You}[0m gave [4m[31m{me}[0m the ride of [4m[31m{my}[0m life . 
(15) [4m[31m{I}[0m tried to give as good as [4m[31m{I}[0m got . 
(16) Even though [4m[31m{he}[0m tried to keep up the spirits , [4m[31m{he}[0m had gone through an emotional 24 hours [4m[31m{himself}[0m , refusing to sleep last night , savoring every hour in [1m[31m{the White House}[0m , working until [34m{the end}[0m -- 
(17) Less than two hours before [4m[31m{he}[0m lost [4m[31m{his}[0m presidential powers , [4m[31m{he}[0m granted [4m[33m{pardons}[0m to 140 Americans , including Henry Cisneros , former Housing Secretary convicted of lying to the FBI , Roger Clinton , [4m[31m{the former President 's}[0m half - brother , John Deutch , the former CIA director who pleaded guilty yesterday to mishandling classified materials , Patty Hearst , and [4m[34m{Susan M Dougal , a friend of the Clintons who served part of her time in the jail for refusing to testify about them}[0m . 
(18) It hurt my mom and dad so much to hear [4m[32m{convicted felon}[0m . 
(19) Now no one can say [4m[32m{that}[0m again . 
(20) By late this afternoon , as movers transported the belongings to the home in Chappaqua , [4m[31m{he}[0m had no longer the power to grant pardons , and at a rally in [35m{New York}[0m , it was [35m{the state 's}[0m new senator who got the spotlight . 
(21) Thank you all so much . 
(22) To those who think [4m[31m{Bill Clinton}[0m has seen [4m[31m{his}[0m last hurrah , [4m[31m{he}[0m has this to say -- `` [4m[31m{I}[0m may no longer be President , but [4m[31m{I}[0m 'll be around . ''
