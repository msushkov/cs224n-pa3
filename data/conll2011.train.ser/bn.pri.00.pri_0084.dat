(0) The political maneuvering going on in [4m[36m{Israel}[0m could put us to shame . 
(1) [1m[32m{The Israeli Parliament}[0m is considering moves that could allow [36m{former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu}[0m to run against [3m[31m{incumbent Ehud Barak}[0m . 
(2) Let 's back up for a minute . 
(3) [3m[31m{Barak}[0m announced 2 weeks ago that [3m[31m{he}[0m would call for [34m{early elections}[0m . 
(4) Then [1m[31m{yesterday}[0m [3m[31m{he}[0m [1m[36m{resigned}[0m , triggering the vote in about 2 months , and guess who under current Israeli law would be ineligible to run for [3m[35m{Prime Minister}[0m ? 
(5) That 's right , [36m{the former front runner Benjamin Netanyahu}[0m . 
(6) You see , [36m{Netanyahu}[0m gave up [36m{his}[0m parliamentary seat last year after [36m{his}[0m election lost to [3m[31m{Barak}[0m and in [4m[36m{Israel}[0m , if you are not in [1m[32m{the Parliament}[0m , you ca n't run for [3m[35m{Prime Minister}[0m . 
(7) [35m{The World 's}[0m Richard Myron explains . 
(8) Against the backdrop of continuing violence in [3m[36m{the West Bank and Gaza Strip}[0m , election campaign has begun here . 
(9) [1m[31m{Yesterday}[0m [3m[31m{Ehud Barak}[0m won the endorsement of [3m[31m{his}[0m Labor Party as [4m[31m{its}[0m candidate for [3m[35m{Prime Minister}[0m and while [3m[31m{his}[0m supporters may be cheering , [31m{many other Israelis}[0m have turned away from [3m[31m{the man they elected just 18 months ago}[0m . 
(10) Opinion polls show [3m[31m{him}[0m neck and neck with the current leader of [4m[35m{the right wing Likud Party}[0m , Ariel Sharon , but [3m[31m{Barak}[0m trails [36m{former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu}[0m by 16 points according to one poll . 
(11) Among [4m[31m{Labor Party}[0m activists such as legislator Yael Dayan there is a sense of confusion about [3m[31m{Barak 's}[0m unpopularity . 
(12) [1m[34m{It}[0m certainly objectively does n't make any sense . 
(13) [1m[34m{It}[0m means we have to try harder and to remind [3m[33m{people}[0m why [3m[33m{they}[0m said such a big no to [36m{Netanyahu}[0m only a year and a half ago . 
(14) [3m[31m{Barak}[0m can win and if [3m[31m{he}[0m comes to [34m{the elections}[0m with an indication of continuation of the peace , [3m[31m{he}[0m 's got a majority . 
(15) [36m{The discredited former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu}[0m now faces a number of legal obstacles before [36m{he}[0m can challenge [3m[31m{Barak}[0m for [3m[35m{the top job}[0m . 
(16) According to [32m{current legislation}[0m only a member of parliament can stand for [3m[35m{the position of Prime Minister}[0m . 
(17) [36m{Netanyahu}[0m supporters are calling either for a change in [32m{the law}[0m or for simultaneous elections for the [1m[32m{Knesset}[0m and [3m[35m{Prime Minister}[0m , which would allow [3m[34m{their}[0m candidate to run . 
(18) Senior [4m[35m{Likud}[0m activists like [4m[32m{Yosee Ahmed}[0m say that [3m[31m{Barak 's}[0m decision to call an election just for [3m[35m{Prime Minister}[0m wo n't save [3m[31m{him}[0m from [3m[31m{his}[0m opponent in [4m[36m{the country}[0m or in [1m[32m{the Knesset}[0m . 
(19) [3m[31m{Barak}[0m did n't just do [1m[36m{some one thing which is very cynical}[0m , [3m[31m{he}[0m also did [1m[36m{something which is not very clever politically}[0m because there is [4m[33m{a , built - in majority in the Knesset against him}[0m and if there are elections only for [3m[35m{Prime Minister}[0m , even if [3m[31m{he}[0m is elected again , how can [3m[31m{he}[0m manage [4m[36m{the country}[0m with [4m[33m{the built - in majority against him}[0m . 
(20) So , [4m[32m{I}[0m would therefore call [3m[31m{his}[0m act an act of extreme irresponsibility . 
(21) As the political tempo quickens in [4m[36m{Israel}[0m , so the violence continues in [3m[32m{the West Bank}[0m and [1m[35m{Gaza}[0m . 
(22) In Bethlehem Palestinians buried another victim of the current troubles killed in fighting [1m[31m{yesterday}[0m with the Israeli Army , but as the casualties on both sides continue to mount , there are also rumors of high level secret contacts between the Israelis and the Palestinians to find a political solution to the conflict . 
(23) Gushin Baskin , co-director of the Israel - Palestine Center for Research and Information says that the prospects of an election in [4m[36m{Israel}[0m could improve the chances for peace . 
(24) [3m[31m{Barak 's}[0m standing in the polls is so bad that the only thing that can save [3m[31m{his}[0m political career now is a peace deal , which is the only reason to be optimistic that something might actually happen . 
(25) It 's that personal self motivation of [3m[31m{Barak 's}[0m desire to survive politically and to have some kind of future in [4m[36m{this country}[0m knowing that if [3m[31m{he}[0m goes to elections with a peace agreement , any kind of peace agreement , [3m[31m{he}[0m stands much better chance of being elected than going to the electorate with nothing . 
(26) Amid the political intrigue in [4m[36m{Israel}[0m an international commission led by [33m{former US senator George Mitchell}[0m today began investigating the causes of the unrest here . 
(27) [33m{Mitchell}[0m said [33m{he}[0m hoped [33m{his}[0m work would reduce the level of violence , but [33m{his}[0m task is going to be difficult amid the mutual accusations and the rising death toll . 
(28) For [35m{The World}[0m [1m[33m{this}[0m is Richard Myron in Jerusalem . 
(29) You are listening to [35m{The World}[0m on PRI , Public Radio International .
