(0) [4m[32m{Vice President Gore}[0m and [4m[35m{Governor Bush}[0m spent [3m[36m{this day}[0m with [4m[34m{their}[0m families , dispatching [4m[34m{their}[0m deputies to score points on the [3m[36m{Sunday}[0m morning interview shows . 
(1) Here 's [4m[31m{NBC 's}[0m Chip Reid . 
(2) Arriving at church with [4m[32m{his}[0m family Sunday -- 
(3) Good morning . 
(4) Hope you all have [3m[36m{a nice Sunday}[0m . 
(5) [4m[32m{Al Gore}[0m continued to refuse comment on the erecognize torl battle in [3m[35m{Florida}[0m , leaving it to [4m[32m{his}[0m point men , William Daley and [32m{Warren Christopher}[0m to defend [3m[34m{the controversial hand recounts now under way}[0m . 
(6) [3m[34m{This}[0m is the procedure called for by [3m[35m{Florida}[0m law . 
(7) [3m[35m{Florida}[0m law provides for an opportunity for hand counts to check machine counts . 
(8) [32m{Christopher}[0m said [3m[34m{the recounts}[0m should be completed within a matter of days and at that point , [4m[32m{Gore}[0m campaign sources contend , [4m[32m{Gore}[0m will be in the lead in [3m[35m{Florida}[0m and on track to win the election . 
(9) Meanwhile , [4m[35m{Governor George Bush}[0m spent [3m[36m{the day}[0m out of public view , behind the gate of [4m[35m{his}[0m ranch in Texas , while [4m[35m{his}[0m point man , James Baker appeared on five network talk shows arguing vigorously that [3m[34m{the hand recounts}[0m are improper and should be stopped . 
(10) [3m[34m{This}[0m opens up tremendous possibilities for human error and indeed [3m[34m{it}[0m opens up tremendous possibilities for something worse than human error , and for mischief . 
(11) [4m[35m{Bush}[0m advisers say if [3m[33m{they}[0m lose that argument in court this week [3m[33m{they}[0m may appeal , and if [3m[33m{they}[0m lose [3m[35m{Florida}[0m , [3m[33m{they}[0m may ask for recounts in other states , where the filing deadline has not yet passed and where the vote is close , including Iowa and Wisconsin , states that could help them win , even without [3m[35m{Florida}[0m . 
(12) There could also be a recount in New Mexico , where the race is a virtual tie . 
(13) New Mexico State Police there have impounded [33m{ballots}[0m in some counties to make sure no one tampers with [33m{them}[0m before any possible recount . 
(14) [4m[36m{The Gore team}[0m is also still considering other options , including going to court if [3m[34m{the hand recount}[0m does not give [4m[36m{them}[0m the lead in [3m[35m{Florida}[0m , so while [4m[33m{both sides}[0m say [4m[33m{they}[0m want to move as expeditiously as possible , [4m[33m{both}[0m are considering strategies that could cause this fight to drag on for weeks . 
(15) [31m{Chip Reid}[0m , [4m[31m{NBC News}[0m , Washington .
