(3) [3m[36m{The move}[0m comes as [34m{the judge}[0m decides whether to order a recount of [4m[34m{those ballots in the presidential election}[0m . 
(4) [1m[35m{NPR 's}[0m Steve Inski was in the courtroom . 
(5) [32m{Steve}[0m , what are the issues that came up in this hearing tonight ? 
(6) [4m[36m{Corey}[0m [34m{Judge N. Sander Sauls}[0m is deciding whether to order a recount as [4m[36m{you}[0m said of [4m[34m{those ballots , 9000 or more actually from Miami Dade County that apparently were never counted at all , at least according to the Democrats in the presidential election and about 3300 ballots from Palm Beach County that were considered by local officials but then thrown out , disallowed}[0m . 
(7) [34m{Judge Sauls}[0m is deciding whether to count [4m[34m{those ballots}[0m and go through [4m[34m{them}[0m and perhaps add some votes to Al Gore 's final total , which is exactly what the Democrats want . 
(8) [34m{He}[0m is not ready to do that yet . 
(9) [34m{He}[0m did not agree to the Democratic proposal to begin counting tomorrow morning but [34m{he}[0m has ordered that [4m[34m{the ballots}[0m be shipped up . 
(10) Later this week , Miami Police apparently are going to escort [4m[34m{them}[0m up to [3m[34m{Tallahassee}[0m and [4m[34m{they}[0m will be ready to be counted if [34m{the judge}[0m decides at a later time to do so . 
(11) Now time is a big consideration from here . 
(12) What 's [34m{the judge 's}[0m timetable ? 
(13) Not as fast as the Democrats would like , not as slowly as Republicans would prefer . 
(14) [34m{He}[0m is going to order [3m[35m{a major hearing on Saturday to review all the legal and evidentiary issues , look at evidence , perhaps hear from witnesses}[0m and after [3m[35m{that}[0m [34m{the judge}[0m will decide if there are any ballots to [1m[34m{count}[0m . 
(15) It might take another five days or so to do [1m[34m{it}[0m . 
(16) Neither side seemed particularly pleased by [3m[33m{the timetable}[0m but [34m{the judge}[0m said , well , [34m{I}[0m am going to make everybody equally unhappy . 
(17) Thank [32m{you}[0m . 
(18) [1m[35m{NPR 's}[0m Steven Inksi reporting from [3m[34m{Tallahassee , Florida}[0m . 
(19) As the battle over votes goes on in [35m{Florida}[0m , [4m[35m{Washington State}[0m is in the middle of [1m[36m{recounting}[0m [31m{the votes cast in its very tight US Senate race}[0m . 
(20) [33m{Jennifer Nesan}[0m reports from member station KPLU in [36m{Seattle}[0m . 
(21) [1m[36m{The recount of the votes cast for Democrat Maria Catwell and Republican senator Slate Gordon}[0m is calm and organized . 
(22) [4m[35m{The state 's}[0m Elections Director Garry Macintosh says [1m[36m{the process}[0m is about as exciting as watching paint dry . 
(23) There are [3m[31m{a lot of things about the election 's process I think that are fairly complex}[0m . 
(24) [1m[36m{This}[0m is n't probably one of [3m[31m{them}[0m . 
(25) [1m[33m{Catwell}[0m leads [3m[32m{Republican incumbent Slate Gordon}[0m by fewer than 2000 votes . 
(26) At this point neither of [4m[33m{the candidates}[0m plan to contest any of [31m{the votes}[0m . 
(27) State law requires a recount when the margin of victory is less than one half of 1 percent . 
(28) [1m[36m{The recount}[0m is expected to be completed by the end of the week . 
(29) No statewide recount in [4m[35m{Washington}[0m has ever changed the initial outcome . 
(30) For [1m[35m{NPR News}[0m , [33m{I}[0m 'm Jennifer Nesan in [36m{Seattle}[0m .
