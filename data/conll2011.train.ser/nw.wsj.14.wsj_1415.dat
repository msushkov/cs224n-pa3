(0) [4m[35m{A bill that would permit the Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies}[0m is facing tough opposition from some [4m[36m{Wall Street}[0m firms , which argue that [4m[35m{the legislation}[0m is unnecessary . 
(1) [4m[35m{The legislation}[0m and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings [34m{this week}[0m by [3m[36m{the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee}[0m and [4m[34m{the Senate Securities Subcommittee}[0m . 
(2) [4m[32m{Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC ,}[0m has n't taken a formal position on [4m[35m{the bill}[0m , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give [3m[33m{the SEC}[0m additional authority during market emergencies . 
(3) However , [4m[32m{he}[0m recently told the Senate Banking Committee that [4m[32m{he}[0m believes [3m[33m{the agency}[0m should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker - dealers , which are frequently used to issue [32m{bridge loans}[0m . 
(4) [32m{The bridge loans}[0m are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions . 
(5) Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high - risk , high - yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk - bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with [4m[36m{Wall Street}[0m firms issuing bridge loans . 
(6) But some [4m[36m{Wall Street}[0m executives argue that such fears are unwarranted . 
(7) In a July 6 letter to [4m[34m{the Senate Securities Subcommittee}[0m , [4m[31m{First Boston Corp.}[0m argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate . 
(8) [4m[31m{First Boston , whose holding company , CS First Boston Group , is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street ,}[0m said [4m[31m{it}[0m is also concerned that once [3m[33m{the SEC}[0m has the power to monitor [3m[35m{holding companies}[0m , [3m[33m{it}[0m will try to regulate [3m[35m{their}[0m activities . 
(9) `` [4m[35m{The proposal , while well - intended}[0m , [31m{I}[0m think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control [3m[33m{the SEC}[0m has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker - dealers , '' [31m{Michael Raoul - Duval , managing director of First Boston ,}[0m said in an interview . 
(10) [4m[35m{The bill}[0m would `` divert scarce resources of [3m[33m{the commission}[0m away from broker - dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker - dealers , '' [31m{Mr. Raoul - Duval}[0m said . 
(11) Sources in [33m{the industry}[0m and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate [33m{the industry}[0m while addressing [3m[33m{the SEC 's}[0m concerns may be possible . 
(12) An aide to [4m[34m{the Senate Securities Subcommittee}[0m says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in [4m[35m{the bill}[0m . '' 
(13) [4m[33m{Edward O'Brien , president of the Securities Industry Association ,}[0m said that [3m[34m{the securities - industry trade group}[0m opposes [4m[35m{the bill as it is written}[0m but that [3m[34m{it}[0m is `` hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve [3m[33m{the SEC 's}[0m goals . '' 
(14) [4m[33m{Mr. O'Brien}[0m will elaborate on [3m[34m{the SIA 's}[0m position in testimony before [3m[36m{the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee}[0m [34m{this week}[0m , a spokesman said .
