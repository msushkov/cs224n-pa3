(0) When [4m[32m{Anne Volokh}[0m and [4m[32m{her}[0m family immigrated to the U.S. [3m[31m{14 years}[0m ago , [3m[36m{they}[0m started life in [4m[34m{Los Angeles}[0m with only $ 400 . 
(1) [3m[36m{They}[0m 'd actually left [4m[35m{the Soviet Union}[0m with $ 480 , but during a stop in Italy [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m dropped $ 80 on a black velvet suit . 
(2) Not surprisingly , [4m[32m{she}[0m quickly adapted to the American way . 
(3) [3m[33m{Three months}[0m after [4m[32m{she}[0m arrived in [4m[34m{L.A.}[0m [4m[32m{she}[0m spent $ 120 [4m[32m{she}[0m did n't have for [32m{a hat}[0m . 
(4) -LRB- `` [32m{A turban}[0m , '' [4m[32m{she}[0m specifies , `` though it was n't the time for [32m{that}[0m [3m[31m{14 years}[0m ago . 
(5) But [4m[32m{I}[0m loved turbans . '' -RRB- 
(6) Since [3m[33m{then}[0m [4m[32m{she}[0m has become wealthy . 
(7) [4m[32m{Her}[0m [31m{husband}[0m and [4m[31m{older son -- a computer prodigy profiled in The Wall Street Journal in 1981 , when he was 13 --}[0m run [3m[34m{a software company with expected sales this year of $ 10 million}[0m . 
(8) Most recently , [4m[32m{she}[0m has become the publisher of [1m[34m{Movieline , a four - year - old Los Angeles magazine that began national distribution last month , with an initial press run of 100,000 copies}[0m . 
(9) Distributed by the Hearst Corp. 's Eastern News , [1m[34m{the glossy publication}[0m melds Vanity Fair 's gossipy archness and Premiere 's earnest delving into behind - the - scenes minutiae , with a special emphasis on Tinseltown as fashion trendsetter . 
(10) [1m[34m{It}[0m 's being sold through bookstores , newsstands and some video stores . 
(11) Though [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m is a small woman , [4m[32m{she}[0m has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that seem perfectly suited to capitalism as it is practiced in Hollywood . 
(12) Certainly life for [4m[32m{her}[0m has changed considerably since the days in Kiev , when [4m[32m{she}[0m lived with [4m[32m{her}[0m parents , [4m[32m{her}[0m husband and [4m[32m{her}[0m two sons in a 2 1/2 - room apartment in what [4m[32m{she}[0m calls `` silent internal immigration , '' dreaming of escape . 
(13) Now , for example , [4m[32m{she}[0m owns [1m[36m{48 hats}[0m . 
(14) However , [4m[32m{she}[0m remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that turban 10 years later and having [3m[35m{a Los Angeles boutique owner}[0m ask [4m[32m{her}[0m if [32m{it}[0m was a Chanel . 
(15) With obvious satisfaction , [4m[32m{she}[0m says [4m[32m{she}[0m told [3m[35m{him}[0m : `` No darling , [4m[32m{I}[0m just give [32m{it}[0m a Chanel look . '' 
(16) [4m[32m{She}[0m keeps track of the rest of [4m[32m{her}[0m hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox . 
(17) Are [1m[36m{the hats}[0m merely part of [4m[32m{her}[0m new [4m[34m{L.A.}[0m persona , along with the many ultra-thin Capri cigarettes [4m[32m{she}[0m smokes , the parties [4m[32m{she}[0m throws for 500 people , the Chekovian feasts [4m[32m{she}[0m offers guests at [4m[32m{her}[0m weekend place in Santa Barbara ? 
(18) `` No , darling , '' [4m[32m{she}[0m said recently in [4m[32m{her}[0m fluent , slightly affected English , during a trip East to promote [1m[34m{Movieline 's}[0m national expansion . 
(19) `` You have to be born with it . 
(20) [4m[32m{I}[0m used to wear [3m[34m{hats}[0m in [4m[35m{Russia}[0m , but [4m[32m{I}[0m had to make [3m[34m{them}[0m and [4m[32m{my}[0m dresses . 
(21) On the hat side [4m[32m{I}[0m was n't getting what [4m[32m{I}[0m wanted . '' 
(22) Now 48 years old , [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m has definite ideas about what [4m[32m{she}[0m wants . 
(23) At [1m[34m{Movieline}[0m , [4m[32m{she}[0m wants `` specific paragraphing , specific tone , a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue - in - cheek . '' 
(24) In restaurants -LRB- in this case , the Russian Samovar , a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres -RRB- , [4m[32m{she}[0m did n't want [35m{the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room}[0m . 
(25) `` You people here think [35m{this}[0m is Russian music , '' [4m[32m{she}[0m said with disdain , and [1m[32m{called}[0m over to the waitress : `` Could you turn [35m{it}[0m off ? '' 
(26) [1m[32m{That}[0m done , [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes [4m[32m{she}[0m feels [4m[32m{she}[0m was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties . 
(27) `` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' [4m[32m{she}[0m said , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik -LRB- `` a little well done , but very good '' -RRB- . 
(28) `` If you are born to give parties , you give parties . 
(29) Even in [4m[35m{Russia}[0m [3m[36m{we}[0m managed to give parties . 
(30) In [4m[34m{Los Angeles}[0m , in [3m[36m{our}[0m lean years , [3m[36m{we}[0m gave parties . '' 
(31) As publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies , [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m sees [4m[32m{her}[0m party - giving as an important part of business . 
(32) [4m[32m{She}[0m has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people , but prefers more intimate gatherings . 
(33) `` At American cocktail parties [4m[31m{everyone}[0m 's always looking over your shoulder to see who [4m[31m{they}[0m can talk to next . 
(34) [4m[32m{I}[0m like rather [36m{tea}[0m , because [36m{it}[0m is at the end of the day . '' 
(35) [4m[32m{She}[0m serves [4m[33m{high Russian tea}[0m , at 5 p.m . 
(36) `` [4m[33m{It}[0m 's supposed to be later but [4m[32m{I}[0m just moved [4m[33m{it}[0m . 
(37) In [4m[34m{Los Angeles}[0m , it 's important to catch people just after work . '' 
(38) [4m[32m{She}[0m also frequently invites directors , producers , actors , writers and other show business people for `` coffee and clips in the pleasure dome . '' 
(39) [3m[35m{Guests}[0m bring movies on tape , and show [3m[35m{their}[0m favorite three - to - five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of [1m[34m{the Volokhs '}[0m art - nouveau library -LRB- `` the pleasure dome '' -RRB- . 
(40) [3m[35m{They}[0m eat `` sinful and sensual things '' -- and explain [3m[35m{their}[0m clips . 
(41) `` It 's very revealing and soul baring , '' said [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m . 
(42) The idea for [1m[34m{Movieline}[0m actually was dreamed up by an old friend of [1m[34m{the Volokhs}[0m , [34m{Boris Krutchensky}[0m -LRB- who has the title of co-publisher -RRB- , and [31m{Laurie Halpern Smith , now the magazine 's co-editor}[0m . 
(43) [34m{Mr. Krutchensky}[0m approached [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m five years ago about backing [1m[34m{the publication , which started out as a listing guide}[0m . 
(44) [4m[32m{She}[0m was interested only if [4m[32m{she}[0m could guide [1m[34m{it}[0m editorially as well . 
(45) `` [4m[32m{Anne}[0m does n't believe in blandness , '' said [31m{Ms. Smith}[0m . 
(46) `` [4m[32m{She}[0m wants things to be exciting . 
(47) And [4m[32m{she}[0m has this inexhaustible energy . 
(48) [4m[32m{She}[0m 'll think of [1m[36m{an idea the editorial people think is impossible}[0m , then [4m[32m{she}[0m 'll have [4m[36m{us}[0m make [1m[36m{it}[0m work . '' 
(49) In fact , [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m was n't just a rich lady who needed a hobby . 
(50) Back in [4m[35m{the Soviet Union}[0m [4m[32m{she}[0m was [4m[32m{a respected journalist}[0m , writing [32m{a weekly column about the national cuisine}[0m for Sunday Izvestia . 
(51) [32m{Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals --}[0m became the basis for [4m[32m{her}[0m erudite and entertaining cookbook , `` The Art of Russian Cuisine , '' brought out in 1983 by [4m[35m{Macmillan Publishing Co}[0m . 
(52) `` [4m[32m{I}[0m do n't trust people who do n't eat , '' said [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m , though [4m[32m{she herself}[0m stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds . 
(53) `` Look at [3m[32m{Dostoevski and Kafka}[0m . 
(54) No one ever eats in [3m[32m{their}[0m books and look at [3m[32m{them}[0m ... . 
(55) Tolstoy 's characters eat , [1m[35m{Pushkin 's}[0m , Gogol 's . '' 
(56) In [4m[32m{her}[0m cookbook , which [4m[35m{Macmillan}[0m is bringing out in soft cover this month -LRB- with [4m[34m{the blini recipe}[0m revised so [4m[34m{it}[0m works -RRB- , [4m[32m{she}[0m introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature : [1m[35m{Pushkin}[0m on blini , Goncharov on piroghi . 
(57) In life , [4m[32m{she}[0m offers practical dieting advice : `` Divide your meals into important and unimportant . 
(58) In a great restaurant , do n't deprive yourself . 
(59) The other meals do n't matter . '' 
(60) Amusing as [4m[32m{she}[0m is , and frivolous as [4m[32m{she}[0m can seem , [4m[32m{this}[0m is a serious person with some difficult memories . 
(61) [4m[32m{She}[0m was the child of relative privilege . 
(62) [4m[32m{Her}[0m mother was a translator ; [4m[32m{her}[0m father was `` the eternal vice director . '' 
(63) `` [4m[32m{I}[0m emigrated to wear better hats , do better parties , '' [4m[32m{she}[0m said with a giggle . 
(64) `` But we should n't leave out political reasons , number one . 
(65) You try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances . 
(66) One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . '' 
(67) By 1973 , after their second child was born , it had become clear to [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m and [4m[32m{her}[0m husband Vladimir , a computer scientist , that [1m[33m{they}[0m wanted to leave [4m[35m{the U.S.S.R}[0m . 
(68) [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m quit [4m[32m{her job}[0m , to remove [4m[32m{herself}[0m from the public eye . 
(69) The wait was miserable . 
(70) Before granting [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh 's}[0m parents a visa , the government required [4m[32m{her}[0m mother to obtain permission from [4m[36m{her}[0m first husband , whom [4m[36m{she}[0m had divorced 38 years earlier . 
(71) [31m{Mr. Volokh}[0m was fired from [31m{his}[0m job , and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from [31m{his}[0m co-workers , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities . 
(72) [1m[34m{The Volokhs}[0m were afraid that [1m[34m{they}[0m 'd end up like a friend of [1m[34m{theirs}[0m who 'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years , having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk . 
(73) [1m[34m{They}[0m did n't . 
(74) [1m[34m{Their}[0m visa came in relatively short order , and [1m[34m{they}[0m moved to [4m[34m{Los Angeles}[0m . 
(75) [31m{Mr. Volokh}[0m soon found work in [31m{his}[0m field , but [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m refused [4m[33m{the obvious and available occupation - as translator for a Russian who spoke fluent English}[0m . 
(76) `` [4m[33m{That}[0m 's always looking back , '' [4m[32m{she}[0m said . 
(77) `` [4m[32m{I}[0m wanted to [3m[36m{be}[0m in business . '' 
(78) On the way to [3m[36m{that goal}[0m , [4m[32m{she}[0m received [4m[32m{her}[0m first U.S. paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry , attended secretarial school , then went to work for [1m[35m{a fund - raising organization}[0m . 
(79) Soon [4m[32m{she}[0m was running [1m[35m{the office}[0m . 
(80) When [4m[32m{her}[0m husband and [4m[31m{son}[0m founded [3m[32m{their}[0m computer company , Vesoft , [4m[32m{she}[0m worked as business manager , bookkeeper and publicist . 
(81) Now [1m[34m{Movieline}[0m is located in the same building as [3m[34m{Vesoft}[0m . 
(82) `` Things work out unexpectedly in life , '' said [4m[32m{Ms. Volokh}[0m . 
(83) `` You never know if you 'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one . 
(84) [3m[36m{We}[0m were lucky .
