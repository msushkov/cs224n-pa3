(1) [3m[33m{The art of calligraphy}[0m is a special kind of art form in China . 
(2) [4m[31m{Each period}[0m has [4m[31m{its}[0m own superior achievements , which combine to make a brilliant and glorious calligraphy history . 
(3) This is exactly why [3m[33m{the Chinese art of calligraphy}[0m wins the strong admiration of friends from many countries of the world . 
(4) [3m[34m{American friends Mr. Sackler and his wife}[0m , have wholeheartedly contributed a lot to carrying forward [3m[36m{our}[0m art of calligraphy , and hope to introduce [3m[33m{this brilliant art}[0m to the world , to let more friends learn and treasure [3m[33m{it}[0m . 
(5) [1m[35m{We}[0m appreciate [3m[34m{their}[0m absolute sincerity . 
(6) The first recently held " Sackler Cup Calligraphy Competition " selected , recommended and widely solicited calligraphy works and treasures of recently budding calligraphers scattered in various places , and has been deeply welcomed by readers . 
(7) In the appraisal and selection process , [1m[34m{the standards we emphasized}[0m were : conforming to classical requirements of [3m[33m{the Chinese art of calligraphy}[0m ; healthy language diction , readable handwriting ; certain standards of writing methods ; solid skills , and self - establishing a new artistic concept -- [1m[34m{these}[0m are the characteristics of [3m[36m{our}[0m Chinese art of calligraphy , and because [3m[36m{we}[0m have [1m[34m{these characteristics}[0m , [3m[36m{we}[0m won the attention of foreign friends . 
(8) Therefore , any work that can follow tradition but not stagnate , and have new artistic concepts will be appraised well . 
(9) In a serious yet harmonious discussion , the [3m[32m{judges}[0m thinking achieved unity and decided this round 's outstanding entries . 
(10) One kind of situation embarrassed [3m[32m{the judges}[0m , namely , that some works displayed really beautifully written characters , conformed to a certain calligraphy style , and showed signs of new achievement in art form , but regretfully , because [3m[31m{the calligraphers}[0m have poor basic knowledge , [3m[31m{they}[0m wrote some wrong characters , and since there was no remedy , finally lost in the selection . 
(11) Everyone both felt pity for [3m[31m{them}[0m , and felt that this is an issue very worth worrying about . 
(12) [1m[36m{Some young calligraphy lovers}[0m , just at the time when [1m[36m{they}[0m should have been studying hard , were hindered . 
(13) So basic knowledge was not enough , structure was not systematic , and the level was rather low . 
(14) [1m[36m{They}[0m have some ability in calligraphy , but eventually can not produce a final masterpiece at a higher level , and can not create works which may be used as teaching models . 
(15) [1m[35m{We}[0m sincerely hope that [1m[36m{these friends}[0m will amend this aspect quickly , and hope future works will show both superior capability in calligraphy , and convey healthy and deep thoughts , and even reveal a clear , meaningful and elegant mind . 
(16) This is the eager expectation that many older - generation calligraphers have placed on us younger - generation .
