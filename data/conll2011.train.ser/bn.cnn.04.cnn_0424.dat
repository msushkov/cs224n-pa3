(0) [4m[33m{The NASA}[0m and the European Space Agency both launch missions to [1m[34m{Mars}[0m this month sending rovers and ashters to probe [1m[34m{the Red Planet}[0m . 
(1) [1m[36m{One of the big questions about Mars}[0m is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit . 
(2) [1m[36m{It}[0m 's an idea plagued with unsolved problems . 
(3) The latest issue of `` Popular Science magazine '' takes a look at the challenges [4m[33m{NASA}[0m is facing . 
(4) Joining [4m[35m{us}[0m is [4m[31m{the contributing editor}[0m . 
(5) Good to see [4m[31m{you}[0m , [4m[31m{Jeff}[0m . 
(6) Thank you . 
(7) It was only about 30 years ago when we went to [34m{the moon}[0m . 
(8) So what 's the difficulty in [3m[32m{being}[0m able to [1m[33m{go}[0m to [1m[34m{Mars}[0m ? 
(9) [3m[32m{It}[0m 's unimaginably difficult and different . 
(10) [1m[34m{Mars}[0m is at most times 100 million miles away from [4m[36m{us}[0m . 
(11) [1m[33m{It}[0m 's a nine - month trip . 
(12) Then if [1m[32m{we}[0m stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three years . 
(13) We 're talking about conditions where there 's [3m[34m{radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer}[0m . 
(14) The communications conditions once you 're on [1m[34m{Mars}[0m , just to talk to people on [4m[36m{earth}[0m , there 's a 20 minute delay in the conversation . 
(15) So you know , the issues are so much larger than going to [34m{the moon}[0m . 
(16) And for now , it 's 250 days , which seems to be the maximum for astronauts in [36m{space}[0m anyway , but as [4m[31m{you}[0m say , it 's a much further travel . 
(17) But let [4m[32m{'s}[0m talk about some of the hurdles that hamper humans to be able to survive there . 
(18) The dust , for one thing . 
(19) Cataracts another . 
(20) Let [4m[32m{'s}[0m talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans to actually get that far and to survive . 
(21) Right . 
(22) Well , first of all , [3m[35m{the spacecraft}[0m would not be launched from [4m[36m{Earth}[0m . 
(23) You 'd have to launch [3m[35m{it}[0m from in [36m{space}[0m already , which means [1m[32m{we}[0m would have to build [3m[35m{it}[0m in [36m{space}[0m . 
(24) So that means [1m[32m{we}[0m need a good shuttle that 's going to take [1m[32m{us}[0m back and forth to build [3m[35m{the spacecraft}[0m . 
(25) Then [1m[32m{we}[0m have to come up with [3m[33m{the fuel that will take it out of the Earth 's orbit all the way to Mars}[0m . 
(26) [3m[33m{That}[0m 's probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something [1m[32m{we}[0m have n't really developed yet , because [1m[32m{we}[0m could n't carry that much fuel , obviously . 
(27) Liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry [3m[36m{all the way}[0m to [1m[34m{Mars}[0m . 
(28) The bigger issue is once [1m[32m{we}[0m get there , [1m[32m{we}[0m ca n't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years , so [1m[32m{we}[0m 're going to have to do all of that on the surface of [1m[34m{the planet}[0m . 
(29) And think of it . 
(30) [1m[34m{Mars}[0m is carbon dioxide , so we ca n't breathe there . 
(31) So [1m[32m{we}[0m 're going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water , to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on [1m[34m{the planet itself}[0m . 
(32) [3m[31m{All of this}[0m is in the works now , but [4m[31m{I}[0m think it 's going to take quite a few years to develop [3m[31m{it}[0m . 
(33) [4m[31m{You}[0m talk about [3m[34m{the cosmic radiation}[0m . 
(34) Then of course there is the zero G bone loss , almost like the eroding of bone to humans that would be at risk as well . 
(35) Absolutely . 
(36) There could be as much as 50 % bone loss in [32m{astronauts in Mars}[0m . 
(37) Why ? 
(38) During the time in [1m[34m{Mars}[0m . 
(39) Because when there is no gravity as there is on [1m[34m{Mars}[0m , [35m{the body}[0m does n't pick up [1m[35m{the calcium in the bones}[0m , so [35m{it}[0m does n't keep getting [1m[31m{the bones}[0m stronger and stronger , so [1m[31m{they}[0m will just lose [1m[35m{it}[0m . 
(40) [32m{They}[0m will be almost like old people even at the age of 40 . 
(41) [4m[31m{Jeff Rothfeder .}[0m 
(42) Thank [4m[31m{you}[0m for joining [4m[35m{us}[0m . 
(43) Looks like it will be some time before [31m{we}[0m make [31m{our}[0m way to [1m[34m{Mars}[0m . 
(44) That 's it for [4m[35m{us}[0m . 
(45) But before [4m[35m{we}[0m go , a look at what 's coming up [33m{next week}[0m . 
(46) A controversial incinerator just about ready to destroy weapons at an Anniston , Alabama , military facility . 
(47) What might be the risk to people downwind . 
(48) That story and much more coming up [33m{next week}[0m . 
(49) Coming up next on [4m[34m{`` CNN Live Sunday ''}[0m a look at America 's storage of gas . 
(50) [4m[34m{That}[0m 's followed by `` People in the News '' profiling Harrison Ford and Harry Potter . 
(51) At 8:00 Eastern , [4m[35m{CNN}[0m presents Road to Baghdad .
