(0) Xinhua News Agency , Paris , February 14th , by reporter Wangda Lu 
(1) [3m[35m{Dumas , Minister for Foreign Affairs in France}[0m pointed out that [4m[32m{France}[0m would not agree with the request of amending [3m[34m{the United Nations Charter}[0m in order to reassign [4m[36m{the seats of the five permanent members of the Security Council}[0m . 
(2) [3m[35m{The French Minister for Foreign Affairs}[0m issued the above statement at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Congress yesterday . 
(3) [3m[35m{Dumas , the Minister for Foreign Affairs}[0m believes that [4m[33m{the UN}[0m was born after World War II and that [4m[32m{France}[0m is the same as other permanent members of [3m[32m{the Security Council}[0m in that all were victors . 
(4) Even though [4m[34m{Germany}[0m and Italy , as defeated countries , [3m[31m{today}[0m have already become democratic countries , nevertheless , when facing past events , is to [4m[35m{look}[0m back a single time at history sufficient or is [4m[35m{it}[0m not ? 
(5) There are reports here that , as great economic powers of [3m[31m{today}[0m , there are always those in [4m[34m{Germany}[0m and Japan who will bring forward the request to reassign [4m[36m{seats of the permanent members of the UN Security Council}[0m . 
(6) Genscher , the German Minister for Foreign Affairs , gave [4m[31m{a speech}[0m on the 11th , hoping that [3m[36m{a united Germany}[0m will be able to play a bigger role in [4m[33m{the UN}[0m and have greater rights to air [3m[36m{its}[0m voice when [4m[33m{the UN}[0m makes decisions . 
(7) [3m[35m{The French Minister for Foreign Affairs}[0m emphasized in response to [4m[31m{this}[0m that such views are " not practical " . 
(8) [4m[36m{The seats of the permanent members of the Security Council}[0m are stipulated in [3m[34m{the United Nations Charter}[0m and to amend [3m[34m{the United Nations Charter}[0m requires the consent of the member countries . 
(9) However , [4m[32m{France}[0m will not agree to amend [3m[34m{the United Nations Charter}[0m .
