(0) There is other news tonight . 
(1) [3m[34m{A breakthrough in the investigation of the terrorist attack on the `` USS Cole . ''}[0m 
(2) More on that from [31m{NBC 's}[0m Jim Miklaszewski at the Pentagon with [31m{an NBC News}[0m exclusive for us . 
(3) [4m[33m{Jim ?}[0m 
(4) Tom , in [3m[34m{a major development}[0m senior U.S. officials tell [31m{NBC News}[0m , [4m[34m{Yemen}[0m authorities are holding [32m{two suspects believed directly involved in the attack on the `` USS Cole ''}[0m and that [4m[35m{at least one of the suspects}[0m is `` key to [3m[35m{the operation}[0m , and talking [4m[35m{his}[0m head off . '' 
(5) U.S. officials report [4m[35m{the suspect}[0m is providing explicit details how [3m[35m{the attack}[0m was planned for more than a year then executed with deadly precision , how one safe house and the suicide boat used in [3m[35m{the attack}[0m were acquired months before [3m[35m{the attack}[0m , that two other suspects , an explosives expert believed to be Iraqi , and another perhaps a Saudi , supervised the operation then left Aden before the bombing . 
(6) [4m[35m{The suspect}[0m also claims [4m[31m{they}[0m got help from low - level [4m[34m{Yemen}[0m officials in forging documents , obtaining vehicles , and concealing [4m[31m{their}[0m operation , but there 's apparently no evidence [4m[34m{the Yemen government itself}[0m was involved . 
(7) Now , despite all of this , sources say [4m[35m{the suspect}[0m still has n't named [4m[31m{those behind the terrorist operation}[0m but with [3m[34m{this breakthrough}[0m , [3m[36m{U.S. officials}[0m are increasingly confident [3m[36m{they}[0m 'll soon know who specifically gave the orders to [3m[35m{attack}[0m [4m[32m{the `` Cole}[0m . '' 
(8) Thank you very much , [31m{NBC 's}[0m Jim Miklaszewski , who will be staying on this story for [31m{us}[0m .
