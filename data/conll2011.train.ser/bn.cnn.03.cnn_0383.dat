(0) [35m{All lumber , no filler .}[0m 
(1) [35m{That}[0m 's the verdict after [4m[33m{baseball officials}[0m x-rayed [3m[31m{Sammy Sosa 's}[0m entire inventory of bats and [3m[35m{found}[0m no evidence of cork or any other substance . 
(2) [3m[35m{That}[0m seems to support [3m[31m{his}[0m contention that [1m[36m{the bat got him ejected Tuesday night}[0m was a fluke . 
(3) Still a decision on what , if any punishment [3m[31m{he}[0m will face in the wake of [1m[32m{that incident Tuesday night}[0m . 
(4) [1m[33m{Gary Tuchman standing by in Chicago , with the latest on the Sosa saga outside of Wrigley Field .}[0m 
(5) Reporter : 
(6) [33m{Leon}[0m , hello to [33m{you}[0m . 
(7) Three hours from now [4m[32m{the Chicago Cubs}[0m take the field against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays here at [1m[31m{Wrigley Field}[0m and [3m[31m{Sammy Sosa}[0m will be out there with [4m[32m{them}[0m but how long will [3m[31m{he}[0m ? 
(8) We could find out [4m[31m{today}[0m . 
(9) [3m[31m{His}[0m punishment , suspension for using a corked bat which is illegal during a game . 
(10) Since [1m[32m{the incident}[0m [1m[35m{33,000 fans in the stands for a night game}[0m [3m[31m{he}[0m received a standing ovation from [32m{almost all of them}[0m . 
(11) [1m[33m{I}[0m heard a few boos but [32m{almost everyone}[0m standing . 
(12) Not everyone believing [3m[31m{this man 's}[0m story , which is it was a mistake but [3m[31m{he}[0m 's a hero here . 
(13) These people want to believe [3m[31m{his}[0m story . 
(14) [1m[32m{It}[0m happened [4m[34m{Tuesday night}[0m . 
(15) In the first inning [3m[31m{he}[0m hit a ground ball , scored a run . 
(16) When [3m[31m{he}[0m hit the ball , [1m[36m{the bat}[0m broke . 
(17) The umpires found cork in [1m[36m{the bat}[0m . 
(18) [1m[34m{It}[0m 's illegal because when you put [1m[34m{it}[0m in [34m{the bat}[0m [1m[34m{it}[0m makes [34m{the bat}[0m lighter . 
(19) They hollow out [34m{the bat}[0m and stick the [1m[34m{cork}[0m in there to mask the hollow sound . 
(20) Then you can swing [34m{it}[0m lighter and you can swing [34m{it}[0m faster . 
(21) [4m[33m{They}[0m took [31m{76 of his bats}[0m for analysis . 
(22) [4m[33m{They}[0m [3m[34m{x-rayed}[0m [31m{the bats}[0m . 
(23) The [3m[34m{x-rays}[0m all came back negative . 
(24) But did [36m{Major League Baseball}[0m have [31m{all of Sammy Sosa 's bats}[0m ? 
(25) [3m[33m{We}[0m are , as [3m[36m{I}[0m said , confident , based on not only the presence of security in [4m[36m{the club house}[0m but also the level of cooperation , the record keeping that [3m[33m{we}[0m reviewed and so forth , that [3m[33m{we}[0m have [31m{all of the bats}[0m . 
(26) So [3m[36m{I}[0m do n't want anyone to misconstrue what [3m[36m{I}[0m said . 
(27) It is conceivable because [3m[33m{we}[0m did n't have physical presence in [4m[36m{the club house}[0m that [3m[33m{we}[0m do not have [31m{them all}[0m but [3m[33m{we}[0m are very confident that [3m[33m{we}[0m do . 
(28) [3m[31m{I}[0m 'm man enough to take everything that [3m[31m{I}[0m 've done for , and [3m[31m{I}[0m still walk yesterday like a man and take the blame , but the [3m[32m{media}[0m [4m[31m{today}[0m , [3m[32m{they}[0m got it like [3m[31m{I}[0m 'm a criminal and that 's something that really bothered [3m[31m{me}[0m and hurt [3m[31m{me}[0m as a man . 
(29) Reporter : 
(30) Now , why did [3m[31m{Sammy Sosa}[0m have [1m[36m{this corked bat}[0m ? 
(31) Well , [3m[31m{he}[0m says [3m[31m{he}[0m has [1m[36m{it}[0m because [3m[31m{he}[0m uses [1m[36m{it}[0m for batting practice to put on a show for the fans . 
(32) They asked [3m[31m{him}[0m how many times [3m[31m{he}[0m 's used [1m[36m{it}[0m during batting practice and [3m[31m{he}[0m says three or four times . 
(33) That raises the question Does [36m{Major League Baseball}[0m have a rule about using corked bats during batting practice .
