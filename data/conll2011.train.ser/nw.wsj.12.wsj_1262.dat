(0) [3m[34m{Your}[0m Sept. 21 article `` It 's So Easy to Get Burned When Buying a Small Firm '' was excellent . 
(1) [3m[31m{I}[0m 've been advising small businesses many years and have lived with the fact that 50 % will go out of business within two years , and 80 % in five years . 
(2) [1m[31m{The economic loss , jobs lost , anguish , frustration and humiliation}[0m are beyond measure . 
(3) And most of [1m[31m{these}[0m are absolutely unnecessary . 
(4) [3m[34m{Your}[0m article points out [1m[35m{the traps people fall into}[0m , but when reviewing [1m[35m{those traps}[0m one sees just about all of [1m[35m{them}[0m could have been avoided . 
(5) [3m[33m{An accountant}[0m did not review the seller 's books before buying a business . 
(6) `` [3m[33m{I}[0m guess [3m[33m{I}[0m was naive , '' [3m[33m{he}[0m said . 
(7) There is a more descriptive word to describe [3m[33m{his}[0m lapse of common sense . 
(8) [1m[34m{Corporate managers who want to start their own business}[0m are the highest failure risks . 
(9) [1m[34m{They}[0m know all the answers and are not used to working more than 40 hours a week . 
(10) [1m[33m{The blue - collar worker who decides to start a business}[0m will listen and take advice . 
(11) [1m[33m{His}[0m humility gives [1m[33m{him}[0m a much better chance of success . 
(12) A few months ago [3m[34m{your}[0m paper reported the results of a study to determine why [36m{Asians who arrive in this country without any money , and unable to speak English ,}[0m become overnight successes . 
(13) [36m{Their}[0m `` secret '' is that [36m{they}[0m gather [3m[32m{a small group of advisers}[0m around [36m{them}[0m , listen to what [3m[32m{they}[0m have to say , prepare a business plan and [36m{they}[0m are on [36m{their}[0m way . 
(14) [1m[36m{Successful American business owners}[0m do the same thing . 
(15) Unfortunately , [1m[36m{they}[0m are in the minority . 
(16) Avoiding failure is easy . 
(17) It 's unfortunate so many must learn the hard way .
