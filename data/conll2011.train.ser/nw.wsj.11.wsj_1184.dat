(0) [4m[32m{General Electric Co.}[0m executives and lawyers provided `` misleading and false '' information to [34m{the Pentagon}[0m in [3m[33m{1985}[0m in an effort to cover up [3m[32m{`` longstanding fraudulent '' billing practices}[0m , federal prosecutors [35m{alleged}[0m in legal briefs . 
(1) [4m[34m{The government 's}[0m startling allegations , [33m{filed}[0m only days before the scheduled start of [4m[33m{a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court}[0m , challenge the motives and veracity of [4m[32m{the nation 's third - largest defense contractor}[0m . 
(2) In a strongly worded response summarizing [1m[31m{a filing made in the same court yesterday}[0m , [4m[32m{GE}[0m asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . '' 
(3) [4m[32m{The company}[0m attacked [4m[34m{the government 's}[0m allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said [4m[32m{its}[0m management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to [34m{the Pentagon}[0m all relevant information about billing practices . 
(4) [31m{The case}[0m strikes at the corporate image of [4m[32m{GE , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative}[0m , and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if [34m{Pentagon}[0m and Justice Department officials take a tough stance . 
(5) [4m[32m{The company}[0m has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices . 
(6) But [4m[34m{the government}[0m now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of [3m[32m{`` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices}[0m . 
(7) [3m[32m{The problems}[0m were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of [4m[32m{the company 's}[0m Space Systems division , which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by [4m[34m{the government}[0m since [3m[33m{1985}[0m . 
(8) [36m{The dispute}[0m stems from [1m[36m{pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case , in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos , reports and documents}[0m . 
(9) Last November , a federal grand jury indicted [4m[32m{GE}[0m on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $ 21 million on a logistics computer contract . 
(10) [4m[32m{The company}[0m , for [4m[32m{its}[0m part , maintains that many of [3m[34m{the disputed documents}[0m are privileged attorney - client communications that should n't be turned over to prosecutors . 
(11) A hearing is scheduled on [1m[36m{the issue}[0m today . 
(12) [4m[34m{The government 's}[0m 136 - page filing covers events leading up to [31m{the current case}[0m and an earlier indictment in March 1985 , when [4m[32m{GE}[0m was accused of defrauding [34m{the Pentagon}[0m by illegally claiming cost overruns on [32m{Minuteman}[0m missile contracts . 
(13) [4m[32m{GE}[0m pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $ 1 million in the [32m{Minuteman}[0m case , which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of [36m{the dispute in the Philadelphia court}[0m . 
(14) In order to show that all of [4m[32m{its}[0m units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts , prosecutors contend that `` high - level [4m[32m{GE}[0m executives '' and company lawyers provided `` misleading statements '' to [4m[31m{then - Air Force Secretary Verne Orr}[0m and other [34m{Pentagon}[0m officials during a series of meetings in [3m[33m{1985}[0m . 
(15) Overall , [4m[34m{the government}[0m contends that [4m[32m{GE 's}[0m disclosure efforts largely were intended to `` curry favor '' with [34m{Pentagon}[0m officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations . 
(16) Prosecutors depict a company that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of [3m[36m{overcharges}[0m from 1983 to [3m[33m{1985}[0m , despite warnings from an internal auditor . 
(17) When [4m[32m{GE}[0m finally disclosed [3m[36m{the problems}[0m , prosecutors contend that [4m[31m{Mr. Orr}[0m `` was erroneously informed that the -LCB- suspected -RCB- practices had only just been discovered '' by [4m[32m{GE}[0m management . 
(18) In [4m[34m{its}[0m brief , [4m[34m{the government}[0m asserted that [4m[34m{it}[0m needs [3m[34m{the internal GE documents}[0m to rebut anticipated efforts by [4m[32m{GE}[0m during [4m[33m{the trial}[0m to demonstrate `` [4m[32m{its}[0m good corporate character . '' 
(19) [4m[32m{GE , which was surprised by the last - minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents ,}[0m countered that senior [4m[32m{GE}[0m managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until [3m[33m{1985}[0m , and that the information was passed on quickly to [4m[31m{Mr. Orr}[0m at [4m[31m{his}[0m first meeting with company representatives . 
(20) Subsequent meetings , initiated after the [4m[32m{company}[0m and two of [4m[32m{its}[0m units were briefly suspended from federal contracts , were held to familiarize [4m[31m{Mr. Orr}[0m with [4m[32m{the company 's}[0m self - policing procedures and to disclose additional information , according to [4m[32m{GE}[0m . 
(21) [4m[32m{GE 's}[0m filing contends that [3m[32m{the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy}[0m involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity . 
(22) [4m[32m{The company 's}[0m conduct `` does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover - up , '' [4m[32m{GE 's}[0m brief asserts . 
(23) `` On the contrary , [3m[31m{it}[0m shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters . '' 
(24) [4m[31m{Mr. Orr}[0m could n't be reached for comment [4m[36m{yesterday}[0m .
