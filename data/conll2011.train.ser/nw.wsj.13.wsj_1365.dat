(0) [3m[31m{The Justice Department}[0m has [1m[35m{revised}[0m certain internal guidelines and [3m[34m{clarified}[0m others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white - collar defendants . 
(1) The most significant changes in [4m[31m{department policy}[0m are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of companies charged under the racketeering law , [4m[32m{a senior department official}[0m said . 
(2) Another important revision of [4m[31m{department policy}[0m is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought under [1m[36m{the racketeering law}[0m , [4m[32m{the official , David Runkel ,}[0m said . 
(3) [3m[31m{The department}[0m distributed the [1m[35m{revisions}[0m and [3m[34m{clarifications}[0m to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , [4m[32m{Mr. Runkel}[0m said . 
(4) The changes apply to prosecutions brought under [1m[36m{the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law}[0m . 
(5) Under [1m[36m{that law}[0m , defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of [3m[33m{a `` criminal enterprise ''}[0m may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of [3m[33m{the enterprise}[0m . 
(6) [1m[36m{The RICO law}[0m has come under criticism from [1m[34m{some defendants and defense lawyers}[0m . 
(7) [1m[34m{They}[0m argue that the rights of [1m[36m{RICO}[0m defendants and third parties not named in [1m[36m{RICO}[0m indictments have been unfairly damaged . 
(8) [3m[31m{The department 's}[0m most significant clarification of existing [1m[36m{RICO}[0m policy is [4m[33m{a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense}[0m , [4m[32m{Mr. Runkel}[0m said . 
(9) `` [3m[32m{That}[0m means that if [3m[36m{the offense}[0m deals with one part of [4m[34m{the business}[0m , you do n't attempt to seize [4m[34m{the whole business}[0m ; you attempt to seize assets related to [3m[36m{the crime}[0m , '' [4m[32m{he}[0m explained . 
(10) In general , the thrust of [3m[31m{the department 's}[0m directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , [4m[32m{Mr. Runkel}[0m said .
