(0) [4m[34m{Bob Novak}[0m 's here with the `` Inside Buzz . '' 
(1) I understand there may be a rift among [4m[33m{the Republican leadership in the Houses}[0m ? 
(2) Yeah , there 's a little tension between [4m[33m{the House Majority Leader , Tom DeLay , and his successor as House Majority Whip and his former deputy , Lloyd Blunt}[0m . 
(3) Kind of came to light when `` The Washington Post '' had [31m{a front - page story showing disagreement on the provision}[0m . 
(4) [4m[31m{DeLay}[0m had [31m{it}[0m taken out . 
(5) [4m[33m{They}[0m 've been disagreeing on [4m[32m{union opposed bill on flex time}[0m . 
(6) There 's just a lot of feeling that [4m[31m{DeLay}[0m does n't feel [33m{Blunt}[0m is doing [32m{the job}[0m as well as [4m[31m{he}[0m did [32m{it}[0m . 
(7) Maybe [4m[33m{they}[0m 're jossling for who 's going to be the next Speaker . 
(8) [4m[34m{I}[0m do n't think Dennis Hastert plans to step down soon anyway . 
(9) Moving on to the Democrats . 
(10) What 's the speculation about [4m[35m{John Edwards}[0m ? 
(11) Some of the national Democratic operatives think [4m[35m{John Edwards}[0m is going to run for President and that [4m[35m{he}[0m ought to get out and concentrate on being reelected Senator of North Carolina which wo n't be easy . 
(12) Some people think White House Chief of Staff would [4m[36m{be}[0m a stronger candidate anyway . 
(13) [4m[34m{I}[0m 'm not sure if [4m[36m{that}[0m 's true , but there 's a lot of feeling this presidental race --
