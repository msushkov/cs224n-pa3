(0) [1m[36m{The Mid East peace talks in Washington}[0m reportedly took a turn for the worse [34m{today}[0m . 
(1) Two senior Palestinian officials [3m[31m{accused}[0m [1m[34m{Israel}[0m of backtracking on proposals aimed at resolving the future of [4m[36m{Jerusalem}[0m . 
(2) [1m[34m{Israel}[0m denied [3m[31m{the accusation}[0m . 
(3) In [1m[33m{the Middle East}[0m , [1m[36m{the continuing violence}[0m seems to underline the urgency of [1m[36m{the talks}[0m . 
(4) At least four more people were killed in [1m[32m{the West Bank and Gaza Strip}[0m with both sides blaming each other for [1m[36m{the bloodshed}[0m . 
(5) [36m{The World 's}[0m Richard Myron is in [1m[35m{Tel Aviv}[0m now . 
(6) [3m[36m{Richard}[0m , describe what 's been happening [34m{today}[0m . 
(7) Well , [35m{we}[0m have had unfortunately what [35m{we}[0m term a busy day here [34m{today}[0m , including a suicide bombing in a Jewish settlement in the northern part of [4m[31m{the West Bank}[0m . 
(8) What apparently happened was that [1m[35m{a Palestinian}[0m went in to a roadside restaurant and [1m[35m{he}[0m blew [1m[35m{himself}[0m up critically injuring a number of people . 
(9) Elsewhere , in [1m[32m{the West Bank and Gaza}[0m there have been deaths of Palestinians . 
(10) [4m[34m{One Palestinian}[0m was apparently shot , so the Israeli Army claims , by Palestinian fire . 
(11) [4m[34m{He}[0m was working in the greenhouse in a Jewish settlement . 
(12) Elsewhere , a number of other Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli forces . 
(13) So [34m{it}[0m has been an unfortunately , as [3m[36m{I}[0m say , busy and bloody day here , and this was happening on [34m{the last Friday in Ramadan , which is a very important day for Muslim prayer}[0m . 
(14) Was there any trouble [34m{today}[0m around the holy sites in [4m[36m{Jerusalem}[0m ? 
(15) [4m[35m{The trouble}[0m was very limited . 
(16) There were some scuffles , there was a little bit of stone throwing and at one point [1m[33m{the Western War Plaza , the area that stands in front of the Jewish holy site of the West Moor}[0m was cleared , [1m[33m{it}[0m is adjacent to [3m[33m{the Muslim site of the Haram al - Sharif or Temple Mount}[0m . 
(17) [3m[33m{This}[0m was cleared because of some stone throwing . 
(18) [4m[35m{It}[0m was fairly limited . 
(19) [4m[32m{The Israeli police and security forces}[0m have acted in the past few weeks to try and ensure that [4m[32m{they}[0m have as much control as possible drafting in 3000 policemen and security officials , also not allowing Palestinians in from [4m[31m{the West Bank}[0m . 
(20) [3m[31m{They}[0m must be 45 years and over to enter the Old City , if [3m[31m{they}[0m are from [4m[36m{Jerusalem}[0m , 35 years and older . 
(21) So it has limited the numbers inside , and therefore the amount of trouble , but there was some scuffle and it was expected in a way that there would be certainly tension and a little bit of trouble there [34m{today}[0m . 
(22) Of course , all of this is happening against the backdrop of [1m[36m{peace talks in Washington , which are in their fourth day today}[0m . 
(23) What about [32m{people on the ground there where you are}[0m ? 
(24) Are [32m{they}[0m hopeful something might come out of [1m[36m{this}[0m ? 
(25) Are [32m{they}[0m even paying heed to what is happening in [1m[31m{Washington}[0m ? 
(26) [3m[36m{I}[0m think people are paying heed because [3m[36m{I}[0m think people realize that there is a sense that it could happen . 
(27) There is a great sense of urgency here . 
(28) They are really berserk . 
(29) The security situation has deteriorated to a very bad level and could deteriorate yet further unless there is some kind of agreement . 
(30) Having said that , [3m[36m{I}[0m think there is really a great sense of pessimism amongst [4m[33m{both sides}[0m . 
(31) Talking of the Israeli side first of all , [36m{the middle ground in Israel}[0m , [3m[36m{I}[0m think , feels very disappointed and to some extent disillusioned with [35m{the Palestinians}[0m and does n't feel that there is much of a possibility for an honest deal . 
(32) [36m{They}[0m do n't trust [35m{the other side}[0m . 
(33) [3m[36m{I}[0m think [36m{they}[0m may want the deal to happen , but [36m{they}[0m do n't trust the intentions of [35m{the other side}[0m . 
(34) [1m[31m{The Palestinians}[0m for [1m[31m{their}[0m part , [3m[36m{I}[0m think , are deeply pessimistic . 
(35) [1m[31m{They}[0m have mistrusted [3m[32m{the Israelis}[0m throughout [31m{this process}[0m and have viewed [31m{the process}[0m as one , which has gradually robbed [1m[31m{them}[0m of [1m[31m{their}[0m rights , and [3m[36m{I}[0m think [1m[31m{they}[0m see any agreement as a sellout . 
(36) So basically neither side enters [1m[36m{this}[0m with a great sense of hope , but [3m[36m{I}[0m think [4m[33m{both sides}[0m ultimately recognize that in a way if [4m[33m{they}[0m are to have some kind of agreement or if [4m[33m{they}[0m are to [3m[35m{live}[0m with each other , [4m[33m{they}[0m have either got to do [3m[35m{it}[0m by negotiation or by blood and [3m[36m{I}[0m think obviously most people would rather live with each other in peace , the peace which can be found through negotiations . 
(37) It sounds then as if there is not necessarily a big willingness at this point to compromise any more than there was earlier , especially as President Clinton comes in to speak with the negotiators tomorrow . 
(38) Well , [3m[36m{I}[0m am speaking of the people , amongst the leadership [3m[36m{I}[0m think there may be a tendency to compromise . 
(39) We have heard reports that [3m[32m{the Israelis}[0m are willing , or at least [4m[33m{the two sides}[0m are close to a deal on [4m[36m{Jerusalem}[0m i.e. that [35m{the Palestinians}[0m would get sovereignty over [1m[32m{East Jerusalem}[0m , which is what [35m{they}[0m have claimed is justly [1m[32m{theirs}[0m and what [35m{they}[0m want , and there is also a talk of borders and the refugees being discussed . 
(40) There is a great sense of urgency , [3m[36m{I}[0m think that a deal should be reached . 
(41) [3m[32m{The Israelis}[0m are particularly keen with the forthcoming election . 
(42) [3m[36m{I}[0m think , [3m[32m{this Israeli government}[0m [3m[34m{wants}[0m to deliver to the people a deal so [3m[34m{that}[0m has something to get the electorate with . 
(43) [35m{The Palestinians}[0m , some could argue , are in a better negotiating position , but equally then if [35m{they}[0m are faced with the prospect of the Prime Ministership of the right wing leader Ariel Sharon , [35m{they}[0m may judge that this is the best time to do a deal equally . 
(44) [36m{The World 's}[0m Richard Myron speaking to [36m{us}[0m from [1m[35m{Tel Aviv}[0m . 
(45) Thank [3m[36m{you}[0m [3m[36m{Richard}[0m for the update . 
(46) Thank [33m{you}[0m , [33m{Lisa}[0m .
