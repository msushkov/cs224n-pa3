(0) In [3m[34m{Cuba}[0m today , [3m[36m{some people}[0m are [35m{viewing}[0m [3m[36m{their}[0m past through the eyes of an American . 
(1) [3m[32m{Thomas Nybo}[0m has [35m{that story}[0m . 
(2) When [3m[33m{Fidel Castro}[0m and [3m[33m{his}[0m rebels stormed [4m[32m{Havana}[0m , [4m[34m{they}[0m were joined by [1m[36m{an intrepid American photographer who spoke little Spanish}[0m . 
(3) [1m[36m{His}[0m name is [1m[36m{Burt Glinn}[0m , and now [1m[31m{most Cubans}[0m are getting [1m[31m{their}[0m first look at [1m[36m{his}[0m photos on display in [4m[32m{Havana}[0m until the end of the month . 
(4) [3m[35m{The collection}[0m is called `` on the road to [4m[32m{Havana}[0m with [3m[33m{Fidel}[0m , '' and is made up of 41 black and white images . 
(5) [1m[35m{Some of the other photographers that were there}[0m had to go back to [1m[35m{their}[0m newspapers and had to go back to [1m[35m{their}[0m offices to send [1m[35m{their}[0m film in , but [1m[36m{I}[0m stayed because , to [1m[36m{me}[0m , [3m[31m{it}[0m was more than a news event . 
(6) [3m[31m{It}[0m was about history , so [1m[36m{I}[0m wanted [1m[34m{the whole story}[0m . 
(7) Capturing [1m[34m{the whole story}[0m was not easy . 
(8) [1m[36m{Glinn}[0m borrowed money from friends just to get to [3m[34m{Cuba}[0m , and had to shoot many of the photos barefoot after [1m[36m{he}[0m lost [1m[36m{his}[0m shoes while being pushed in a crowd . 
(9) [36m{The resulting photos}[0m show the passion of [1m[32m{the Cuban people}[0m and the charisma of [1m[32m{their}[0m new leader , standing at the center of it all , just as [3m[33m{he}[0m is 42 years later . 
(10) [1m[36m{Glinn}[0m is 75 now -- about the same age as [3m[33m{Castro}[0m -- and this is [1m[36m{his}[0m second trip back to [3m[34m{Cuba}[0m since [4m[31m{the revolution}[0m . 
(11) When [1m[36m{he}[0m looks back at [1m[36m{his}[0m long career , including stints in South Africa and the former Soviet Union , [4m[33m{one assignment}[0m stands out , and [4m[33m{this}[0m was the most exciting , because [4m[33m{it}[0m turned out to be not a story about [3m[33m{Fidel Castro}[0m . 
(12) [4m[33m{It}[0m turned out to be a story about [1m[32m{the Cuban people}[0m , and how [1m[32m{they}[0m received [4m[31m{the revolution}[0m , and [4m[33m{it}[0m 's so important , because the visions that [1m[33m{foreigners}[0m have -- particularly Americans -- about [4m[31m{the revolution}[0m are completely different . 
(13) [1m[33m{They}[0m do n't understand the kind of popular joy that was here . 
(14) While some might disagree about [3m[34m{Cuba 's}[0m present , and plot different courses for [3m[34m{its}[0m future , [36m{these photos}[0m may help [3m[34m{Cuba}[0m better understand [3m[34m{its}[0m past . 
(15) [3m[32m{Thomas Nybo}[0m , CNN .
