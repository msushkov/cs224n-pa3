(0) [3m[35m{Wives}[0m May Not Benefit When Men Do Chores 
(1) WHEN [4m[33m{HUSBANDS}[0m take on more housework , [4m[33m{they}[0m tend to substitute for chores done by the kids rather than by [3m[35m{the wife}[0m . 
(2) [1m[34m{Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider}[0m analyzed a large sample of [3m[31m{married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18}[0m . 
(3) [3m[31m{The women}[0m indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate share each did . 
(4) Not unexpectedly , [3m[31m{wives}[0m , whether working or non-working , did by far the most -- about 80 % of the shopping , laundry and cooking , and about two - thirds of housecleaning , washing dishes , child care and family paper work . 
(5) Only for yardwork and home maintenance did [3m[31m{women}[0m do less than half . 
(6) But [1m[34m{the researchers}[0m found that while [31m{children 's}[0m household tasks eased [3m[31m{the mother 's}[0m burden appreciably , the husband 's helping hand `` appears to lighten [31m{the children 's}[0m load almost on a one - for - one basis and to reduce [3m[31m{the wife 's}[0m responsibility only modestly . '' 
(7) This pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples . 
(8) In these families , husbands took on 80 % more chores than in couples with only grammar school education . 
(9) But the kids with highly educated parents did 68 % less housework than those in less - educated families . 
(10) `` It is clear , '' Ms. Waite says , `` that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping [3m[35m{the wife / mother}[0m . 
(11) [3m[35m{Her}[0m share decreases , but only slightly . '' 
(12) Nursing Home Patients Apt to Be Private Payers 
(13) [1m[32m{FAR FEWER elderly nursing home residents}[0m bankrupt [1m[32m{themselves}[0m than was previously believed , [3m[33m{two recent studies}[0m declare . 
(14) State governments place very low ceilings on how much property [34m{people}[0m may own or how much income [34m{they}[0m may keep if [34m{they}[0m want welfare help on medical bills . 
(15) Conventional wisdom has long held that [1m[32m{anywhere from one - fourth to one - half of all elderly long - term care patients}[0m are obliged to spend [1m[32m{themselves}[0m into poverty before qualifying for [36m{Medicaid}[0m assistance . 
(16) But [3m[33m{separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute}[0m find that [1m[35m{`` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- only about 10 % -- of residents}[0m start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to [36m{Medicaid}[0m levels in a single nursing home stay before [1m[35m{they}[0m die or are discharged . 
(17) -LRB- [4m[36m{Another one - third}[0m are already on [36m{Medicaid}[0m when [4m[36m{they}[0m enter the nursing homes , a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated . -RRB- 
(18) But [32m{a remarkably high percentage -- over half --}[0m are private payers throughout [32m{their}[0m stay , even a fairly lengthy one . 
(19) [4m[31m{About one - third}[0m pay out of [4m[31m{their}[0m own pockets , while the rest are covered throughout by Medicare , private insurers or the Veterans Administration . 
(20) [3m[33m{Both reports}[0m are based on several thousand patients sampled in a 1985 nationwide government survey . 
(21) [3m[32m{The Brookings and Urban Institute authors}[0m caution , however , that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration , and reaching [1m[33m{the Medicaid level}[0m is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays . 
(22) Moreover , [3m[32m{they}[0m note , [1m[31m{those who manage to pay their own way}[0m often do so only by selling [1m[31m{their}[0m homes , using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives . 
(23) [1m[31m{Reagan}[0m Era Young Hold Liberal Views 
(24) [4m[32m{THE REAGAN generation young men and women reaching political maturity during Ronald Reagan 's presidency --}[0m are firmly liberal on race and gender , according to [36m{NORC , the social science research center at the University of Chicago}[0m . 
(25) Many political analysts have speculated that [1m[36m{the Reagan years}[0m would produce a staunchly conservative younger generation . 
(26) [36m{NORC 's}[0m most recent opinion surveys [3m[36m{find}[0m the youngest adults indeed somewhat more pro-Reagan and pro-Republican than other adults . 
(27) But , says chief investigator Tom Smith , [3m[36m{this}[0m `` does not translate into support for conservatism in general or into conservative positions on feminist and civil rights issues . '' 
(28) Answers to a dozen questions in [33m{the 1986 , 1987 , 1988 and 1989 national surveys}[0m reveal that [35m{men and women in the 18 to 24 age bracket}[0m are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were the 18 to 24 year olds in [36m{NORC 's}[0m polling in the early 1970s and early 1980s . 
(29) [35m{They}[0m were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the 1986 through 1989 surveys . 
(30) For example , [4m[35m{66 % of the 18 to 24 year olds in the four latest surveys}[0m favored an `` open housing '' law prohibiting homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers . 
(31) [4m[35m{That}[0m compares with 58 % of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55 % in the 1972 through 1975 surveys . 
(32) Asked whether [3m[34m{they}[0m agreed or disagreed with the claim that men are emotionally better suited to politics than women , [3m[34m{70 % of the Reagan generation}[0m disagreed , compared with under 60 % of younger men and women in the earlier years . 
(33) Odds and Ends 
(34) SEPARATED and divorced men and women are far more likely to be smokers than married persons , the Centers for Disease Control discovers ... . 
(35) [1m[34m{Graduate students}[0m are taking longer than ever to get [1m[34m{their}[0m doctor of philosophy degrees , [1m[33m{the National Research Council}[0m says . 
(36) [1m[33m{It}[0m estimates the time between college graduation and the awarding of a Ph. D. has lengthened by 30 % over the past 20 years , with the average gap now ranging from about 7.4 years in the physical sciences to 16.2 years in education .
