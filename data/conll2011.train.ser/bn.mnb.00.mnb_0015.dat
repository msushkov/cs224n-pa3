(0) [1m[33m{We}[0m realize that many of the people joining [1m[33m{us}[0m here [36m{tonight}[0m for this broadcast are doing so to try to get more information . 
(1) These are uncertain times . 
(2) [1m[34m{The nation}[0m has yet to elect a President - elect . 
(3) It 's something [31m{Mike Barnicle}[0m said earlier on [1m[33m{our}[0m air [32m{today}[0m that caught [1m[33m{our}[0m eyes and ears and [1m[33m{we}[0m 'd like [31m{Mike}[0m to come back here live . 
(4) [31m{You}[0m were talking about [1m[34m{this country , how it felt to be an American today}[0m . 
(5) Yeah , Brian . 
(6) There is a sense of [31m{I}[0m think increasing despondency in [1m[34m{the country}[0m as we continue on this . 
(7) [1m[36m{Tuesday}[0m night was the longest night and it 's turning into perhaps the longest month . 
(8) People are depressed enough about politics . 
(9) There 's probably reason why these two candidates split this vote so evenly down the middle . 
(10) Neither one managed to ignite the hopes and dreams of Americans . 
(11) In `` U.S.A. Today '' there is [35m{a map 'am of the vote on Tuesday , the red for Bush , blue for Gore}[0m . 
(12) [35m{County by county assessment of how the vote went on Tuesday}[0m and [35m{it}[0m 's sort of looking at [1m[34m{the nation}[0m in terms of Wal - mart versus Martha Stewart . 
(13) People who believe in school player , gay marriage , people who drive Ford Explorers and who drive Volvo station wagons . 
(14) There are these splits in the [1m[34m{country}[0m ands with as we increasingly head toward litigation in terms of who the next President of of [1m[34m{the United States}[0m is going to be , [1m[32m{more and more people}[0m are becoming more depressed about the process . 
(15) It gives [1m[32m{them}[0m a sense of what [1m[32m{they}[0m have felt for too long now , that politics is just name - callers , increased partisanship , special prosecutors , reliance on lawyers and things that do n't affect the ordinary person , that all that has now mushroomed into something called the Presidency of [1m[34m{the United States}[0m and how we elect a President . 
(16) The fact that as we continue on this road and continue to talk about what 's going to happen in Florida , [4m[36m{the judges}[0m have really already [34m{spoken}[0m on this , [4m[36m{the ultimate judges , the people}[0m . 
(17) [4m[36m{Their}[0m decision is now being reviewed . 
(18) Accurately , [31m{I}[0m think , and what [33m{more people}[0m seem to be saying to [31m{me}[0m is that [33m{they}[0m want an accurate recount . 
(19) [33m{They}[0m want [1m[31m{a legitimate recount}[0m , an announcement of [1m[31m{it}[0m , [33m{they}[0m want a winner declared and [33m{they}[0m want a transition to begin . 
(20) NBC [33m{they}[0m on [1m[36m{Tuesday}[0m . 
(21) [33m{They}[0m want a winner . 
(22) [31m{Mike Barnicle}[0m , `` New York Daily News . '' 
(23) Thank [31m{you}[0m for coming on [36m{tonight}[0m and repeating that for [1m[33m{us}[0m .
