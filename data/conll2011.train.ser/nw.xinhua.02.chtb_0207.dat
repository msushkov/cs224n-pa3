(0) [33m{Tingfang Ye}[0m 
(1) At 3,776 meters above sea level , [4m[32m{Mount Fuji}[0m does n't even reach one half way up Mount Qomolangma , but in this archipelago on the western rim of the Pacific Ocean , [4m[32m{she}[0m [4m[34m{is}[0m still the greatest of 1,000 peaks and a masterpiece of nature . 
(2) [4m[34m{This}[0m makes [4m[32m{her}[0m stand out among the world 's innumerable volcanic remnants like a crane among chickens . 
(3) No wonder that Japanese people regard [4m[32m{her}[0m as a gift of nature and call [4m[32m{her}[0m " sacred mountain . " 
(4) It just so happened that the annual meeting of the International Germanic Language and Literature Association that is held every five years was [1m[33m{held}[0m in [4m[33m{Tokyo}[0m this year . 
(5) [1m[33m{This}[0m allowed [33m{this writer}[0m to get a glance at [4m[32m{Fuji 's}[0m charisma and to be able to settle realizing an " inordinate ambition " of many years . 
(6) [4m[32m{Mount Fuji}[0m [1m[35m{is}[0m only 80 kilometers from [4m[33m{Tokyo}[0m -- [1m[35m{this}[0m obviously was also specially arranged by good fortune : [1m[32m{this island nation 's}[0m highest mountain and [1m[32m{her}[0m largest city depend on [4m[31m{one another}[0m as partners and mutually reflect [4m[31m{one another}[0m . 
(7) Thereupon , like a light boat on a familiar route , [32m{the large tour bus that we rode}[0m raced directly toward the southwest -- the direction of [4m[32m{Mount Fuji}[0m . 
(8) Without anyone being aware of [36m{it}[0m , the dense forest almost completely [36m{sealed}[0m [35m{the road}[0m off from the sky above . 
(9) It turned out that [35m{the road}[0m had already narrowed , moreover [35m{it}[0m was sloping . 
(10) One look out the window was enough for one to know that [32m{the bus}[0m was already suspended half way up [4m[32m{the mountain}[0m ! 
(11) In just a little bit , at a small patch of open terrain , [1m[36m{the tour guide --- a woman with mastery of five European languages --}[0m ordered [32m{the bus}[0m to stop . 
(12) [1m[36m{She}[0m let [3m[35m{everyone}[0m hasten to view and enjoy [4m[32m{the sacred mountain 's}[0m countenance , taking advantage of an opportune moment of [4m[35m{the sun}[0m revealing [4m[35m{his}[0m smiling face and extending [4m[35m{his}[0m greeting to [3m[35m{us}[0m . 
(13) [33m{I}[0m raised [33m{my}[0m head in expectation . 
(14) Holy Cow ! 
(15) [4m[32m{It}[0m was at least still more than 1,000 meters in height and the precipitous slope was n't under 60 plus degrees . 
(16) Nearby there was a level slope a few hundred meters wide amidst rows of green trees and withered trees , exposing [31m{raked brown - grey gravel}[0m . 
(17) [31m{This}[0m apparently was the remains of the volcanic ash from the most recent eruption in 1707 . 
(18) [1m[36m{The tour guide}[0m was urging [3m[35m{everyone}[0m to board [32m{the bus}[0m . 
(19) [33m{I}[0m asked [1m[36m{her}[0m : how long would it take to climb to [4m[36m{the summit}[0m from here on foot ? 
(20) [1m[36m{She}[0m replied proclaiming : four to seven hours ! 
(21) [33m{I}[0m extended [33m{my}[0m tongue and raised [33m{my}[0m head , imagining and hoping for a glance at [4m[36m{the summit}[0m , but only saw clouds wafting in the air . 
(22) [33m{I}[0m saw no lofty mountain peak . 
(23) [32m{The large tour bus}[0m started up again and [33m{I}[0m thought , this time [34m{we}[0m have to be going straight to [4m[32m{Fuji 's}[0m " ears . " 
(24) Suddenly a sound broke [33m{my}[0m train of thought : " It 's not right , [33m{Old Ye}[0m , how can [32m{this bus}[0m go straight down ? " --- that was one of [33m{my}[0m Chinese colleagues . 
(25) Thereupon , [33m{I}[0m agitatedly got up and asked [1m[36m{the tour guide}[0m : " Why are [34m{we}[0m going back after only just getting half way up [4m[32m{the mountain}[0m ? " 
(26) [1m[36m{She}[0m said : " Touring [4m[32m{Mount Fuji}[0m does n't at all imply mountain climbing . 
(27) What 's more , [4m[32m{Fuji 's}[0m scenery is not all concentrated at [4m[36m{the summit}[0m y' know . 
(28) The scenic spots at [1m[34m{the foot of the mountain}[0m are plentiful ! " 
(29) So evidently [32m{the bus}[0m really was [3m[34m{carrying}[0m [34m{us}[0m down [4m[32m{the mountain}[0m ! 
(30) [3m[34m{That}[0m being the case , [33m{I}[0m lost no time in again catching an eyeful of [4m[32m{Fuji 's}[0m peak --- [33m{I}[0m practically glued [33m{my}[0m eyes to the glass of the bus window , facing the rear in hope . 
(31) By coincidence , just while looking at [3m[32m{the ever - changing clouds}[0m , [3m[32m{they}[0m were fortuitously located at [4m[36m{the summit}[0m , and resembling cotton , [3m[32m{they}[0m tore open a hole as if deliberately allowing [4m[32m{the " sacred " one 's}[0m forehead to venture out , as if seeing [33m{me}[0m off and also as if laughing at [33m{me}[0m . 
(32) For an instant , a sigh of regret for " great aspirations difficult to fulfill " overwhelmed [33m{me}[0m ! 
(33) Because [33m{I}[0m 'd already come across a face that resembled an old man of lofty mountains many times ! 
(34) At a spacious and luxurious restaurant at [1m[34m{the foot of Fuji}[0m [34m{we}[0m ate a definitely not sumptuous western meal . 
(35) [3m[35m{Everyone}[0m hurriedly cast aside cups and plates , then without leave went nearby and viewed and enjoyed [1m[31m{the famous first of " Fuji 's Five Lakes , " Lake Kawaguchi}[0m , and the enchanting sights of [1m[31m{its}[0m surroundings . 
(36) At this time the weather got overcast and the water of [1m[31m{the lake}[0m was still like a mirror , causing people to think of our country 's Jiuzhaigou 's Mirror Lake , and with the result that [1m[31m{it}[0m had a kind of special , mysterious flavor . 
(37) In the middle of [1m[31m{the lake}[0m , besides a couple of slowly moving pleasure boats , there was also the reflection of a group of hills , rising and falling . 
(38) It was especially the reflection of [4m[32m{the " sacred mountain "}[0m that most caused people to express wonder . 
(39) The luxurious growth by the shore seemed exactly like [4m[32m{her}[0m emerald necklace . 
(40) In the forest the crow 's calls accompanied the happy appearance of the flowers ... ... yet this place still did n't hold [3m[35m{us}[0m so enthralled by the scenery as to forget to go home . 
(41) After some hours [34m{we}[0m then arrived at the famous Hakone scenic area that together with [4m[32m{Fuji}[0m belongs to Izu Park . 
(42) [4m[32m{The volcano 's}[0m wonders appeared prominently before [34m{our}[0m eyes . 
(43) The " fire " had already been dormant for 400,000 years , yet vapors rising everywhere and [3m[33m{crystal clear , boiling hot springs}[0m testified to [4m[32m{her}[0m vitality and power . 
(44) Even though the stink of sulfur filled the air in all directions , nevertheless , people still bravely competed in eating those eggs that had been cooked done and cooked black by [3m[33m{the hot springs}[0m . 
(45) Amazing girls still extended tiny hands into [3m[33m{the hot springs}[0m to test the temperature , but strangely cried out with sharp sounds on being scalded . 
(46) [3m[33m{This}[0m was just " [3m[36m{Hakone 's}[0m Seven Scalds " -LRB- meaning the seven hot springs -RRB- whose name is known far and wide . 
(47) [3m[33m{It}[0m , along with the landscape of the Impenetrable Pass Ancient Road and One Thousand Streams Waterfall , the Nine Headed Dragon , the Immortal 's Stone Field , as well as the numerous Stone Buddhas Groups , etc. of " [3m[36m{Hakone 's}[0m Eight Li " , makes up a large tourist attraction . 
(48) The mountain - climbing bus , the electric cable car , and the suspended cable car that shuttle back and forth make [3m[31m{this whole group all}[0m visible to the eye below . 
(49) The volcano lake , seven kilometers in circumference , below not far away --- Reed Lake , forms a splendorous contrast with [3m[31m{it}[0m . 
(50) [33m{I}[0m once had the thought that , relying on [1m[32m{Japan 's}[0m technology and economic strength [1m[32m{she}[0m would be able to build a road to [4m[36m{the summit}[0m or simply put up a cable car , that the reason that [1m[32m{she}[0m has buses come to make a sharp turnabout at 2,400 meters above sea level just possibly is in order to leave you with a certain degree of difficulty or " uncertain " feeling , to put you into the state of having something within sight but beyond reach , to suspend your appetite for a long , long time . 
(51) Because beauty really does n't lie in the time of the realization of a desire but lives profoundly in the yearning for the goal . 
(52) If [33m{I}[0m had ascended [4m[36m{this dangerous peak}[0m that day then perhaps [4m[32m{this " sacred mountain "}[0m then would lose [4m[32m{her}[0m eternal enchantment .
