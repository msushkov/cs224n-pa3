(0) [3m[32m{Secret new evidence}[0m has prompted another delay in [3m[33m{the trial of two Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103}[0m . 
(1) [1m[31m{Tom Mintier}[0m has details . 
(2) Already in [3m[33m{its}[0m sixth month , [3m[33m{the Lockerbie trial of two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland 12 years ago}[0m is moving at a snail 's pace . 
(3) The latest series of delays come as [3m[32m{new information}[0m has been revealed to [1m[32m{the defense}[0m by [3m[35m{the prosecution}[0m . 
(4) Such a move in the middle of [1m[34m{a trial}[0m is considered highly unusual unless [1m[35m{the information}[0m is so sensitive [1m[35m{it}[0m could harm [3m[36m{the case}[0m if not revealed during [1m[34m{the trial}[0m . 
(5) [3m[32m{The information}[0m includes details of six new potential witnesses and other information from six countries on three different continents . 
(6) It is not yet clear whether [3m[32m{the new information}[0m will help or hurt the case against [1m[33m{the two Libyans accused of blowing up the airplane}[0m . 
(7) Prosecutors have handed over a file described in [1m[36m{court}[0m as being an inch thick . 
(8) Defense lawyers say [3m[32m{the new information}[0m , if true , will have the greatest conceivable effect on [3m[33m{the trial}[0m . 
(9) Two weeks ago , prosecutors revealed the existence of [3m[32m{the new information}[0m and just this Monday , handed [3m[32m{it}[0m over to defense lawyers . 
(10) Teams of investigators have now fanned out to conduct interviews related to [3m[32m{this new information}[0m for [1m[32m{the defense team}[0m . 
(11) [3m[32m{That information}[0m could cause [3m[33m{the trial}[0m to be delayed even further . 
(12) [1m[32m{The defense team}[0m has already told [1m[36m{the court}[0m that more time may be required to react to [3m[32m{the new information}[0m . 
(13) So far , the three Scottish judges sitting to hear [3m[36m{this case}[0m have not been [4m[31m{told}[0m any of the details of [3m[32m{the new information}[0m . 
(14) [4m[31m{That}[0m may change next week if and when another delay in [3m[33m{the trial}[0m is requested by [1m[32m{the defense}[0m . 
(15) Just how important [3m[34m{is}[0m [3m[32m{the new information}[0m ? 
(16) [3m[34m{That}[0m is difficult to say , because so far , only investigators and lawyers for the [1m[32m{defense}[0m and [3m[35m{prosection}[0m know what [3m[32m{it}[0m is . 
(17) In [1m[36m{court}[0m on Tuesday , one of [1m[32m{the lawyers for the defense}[0m defended all the secrecy saying , `` lives are in danger . '' 
(18) At one time , there were predictions that [3m[33m{this trial}[0m would be completed before November and the U.S. elections for President . 
(19) Now [3m[33m{it}[0m is looking more likely to spill into the new year , but no one is exactly willing to say which new year . 
(20) [1m[31m{Tom Mintier}[0m , CNN , Camp Zeist , The Netherlands .
