(0) Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , August 31st , by reporter Jihua Wen 
(1) [33m{President Zemin Jiang}[0m will soon be visiting [3m[34m{Russia}[0m , the Ukraine and [34m{France}[0m . 
(2) Recently , [33m{he}[0m was respectively interviewed by reporters from [3m[34m{Russia}[0m and [34m{France}[0m at the Fangfei Garden of the Diaoyutai State Guest House , and answered questions on the Sino - Russian , Sino - French relations , and regional , international issues . 
(3) When a reporter asked about the present situation of Sino - Russian relations and the prospects of co-operation , [33m{President Zemin Jiang}[0m said that relations between [1m[36m{the countries of China and Russia}[0m have been developing smoothly in the areas of politics , economy and trade , science and technology , education , culture , etc. , in the past 3 years , especially after [3m[35m{President Yeltsin 's}[0m visit to [1m[33m{China}[0m at the end of 1992 . 
(4) [1m[36m{Both countries}[0m have maintained high level contact and relations ; negotiations on border divisions have achieved important results and significant progress has been made in disarmament negotiations at the border regions . 
(5) Trade volume has exceeded the highest historical levels of Sino - Russian trade for two years running . 
(6) [1m[33m{China}[0m and [3m[34m{Russia}[0m have become important mutual trade partners . 
(7) [33m{He}[0m said that " [1m[36m{the two countries of China and Russia}[0m are close neighbors . 
(8) [33m{I}[0m think that the people of [1m[36m{the two countries , namely China and Russia}[0m are happy about the development of relations between [1m[36m{the two countries}[0m . " 
(9) [33m{Zemin Jiang}[0m said to Russian reporters : " at the invitation of [3m[35m{President Yeltsin}[0m , [33m{I}[0m will be visiting [3m[34m{your beautiful country}[0m in two days . 
(10) Together with [3m[35m{President Yeltsin}[0m and other Russian leaders , [33m{I}[0m will explore establishing friendly , neighborly and mutual , co-operative Sino - Russian relations that will extend into the 21st century so as to raise the co-operation of [1m[36m{the two countries}[0m in various areas to a new level . " 
(11) When a reporter asked whether the fact that now a large number of Chinese citizens overstay short - term visas after entering [3m[34m{Russia}[0m will become a factor in tense relations between [1m[33m{China}[0m and [3m[34m{Russia}[0m and how this problem should be solved , [33m{Zemin Jiang}[0m expressed that with the continuous development of friendly , neighborly relations between [1m[33m{China}[0m and [3m[34m{Russia}[0m in recent years , [1m[36m{the two countries}[0m are no longer isolated from [3m[36m{each other}[0m , and relations between [1m[36m{them}[0m have expanded , with rapidly increasing staff contacts . 
(12) This process is very natural . 
(13) [33m{He}[0m said that " because necessary legislation and measures can not keep up with demands of the situation and development , certain phenomena of disorder occur , especially in contact at the border regions , resulting in some passive influences . 
(14) We hold that this type of situation is not good and should be improved and stopped . 
(15) In recent days , the situation has improved to a certain extent because [1m[36m{both sides}[0m have co-operated in the adoption of some measures . " 
(16) [33m{Zemin Jiang}[0m said that " we should not ' stop eating because of a hiccup ' . 
(17) [33m{I}[0m hold that this is a problem that appears while relations between [1m[36m{the two countries}[0m are being developed , and that if [1m[36m{both China and Russia}[0m take sincere , friendly , calm and realistic attitudes towards a joint effort , [4m[35m{these problems}[0m can be solved appropriately , and that [4m[35m{they}[0m are not , nor can [4m[35m{they}[0m be factors of tense Sino - Russian relations . " 
(18) Speaking of the reason for the decrease in the volume of trade between [1m[33m{China}[0m and [3m[34m{Russia}[0m so far this [1m[35m{year}[0m , [33m{Zemin Jiang}[0m said that " We have noticed that compared to [35m{the same period last year}[0m , there is [3m[32m{a drop in the volume of trade between the two countries , China and Russia}[0m , in [1m[32m{the first half of this year}[0m . 
(19) The reasons for [3m[32m{the drop}[0m are manifold : [1m[36m{both China and Russia}[0m are implementing economic reforms , and there are changes in demands for [3m[36m{each other 's}[0m goods ; changes in the visa system have also brought some effects in contacts between traders of [1m[36m{both sides}[0m . 
(20) In international trade , increases and decreases in trade volume happen frequently . 
(21) [33m{I}[0m believe that [3m[32m{the drop in the volume of trade between China and Russia}[0m is only a temporary phenomenon . 
(22) Through joint efforts of [1m[36m{both sides}[0m in encouraging large , powerful and reputable companies from [3m[36m{each country}[0m to develop co-operation , trade between [1m[36m{both countries}[0m will develop even more healthily . 
(23) There is no doubt that issues in this area will be within the scope of talks between the leaders of [1m[36m{both countries}[0m . " 
(24) When interviewed by French reporters , [33m{Zemin Jiang}[0m said that " the situation in the development of [4m[31m{relations between China and France}[0m has been very good since [4m[31m{their}[0m normalization [1m[35m{this year}[0m . 
(25) Prime Minister Barisque visited [1m[33m{China}[0m in April , and now at the invitation of President Mitterrand [33m{I}[0m will be carrying out a visit to [34m{France}[0m for national affairs . 
(26) Trade relations between [36m{the two countries}[0m have also more quickly reached normalization and development . 
(27) In [1m[32m{the first half of this year}[0m , French exports to [1m[33m{China}[0m increased by 42.2 % compared with [35m{the same period last year}[0m . " 
(28) [33m{Zemin Jiang}[0m pointed out that [36m{China and France}[0m are strongly complementary to each other in economy , and that development prospects are good . 
(29) [36m{Both sides}[0m have quite a lot of identical or similar viewpoints on international issues . 
(30) [33m{He}[0m said that " [33m{I}[0m believe that as long as [36m{both sides}[0m make joint efforts , friendly co-operative relations between [36m{the two countries}[0m will definitely continue to develop on the principles of the Sino - French communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations and the joint communique issued on January 12th [1m[35m{this year}[0m . " 
(31) When reporters asked about [1m[31m{North Korea 's}[0m nuclear issue and [1m[33m{China 's}[0m role , [33m{Zemin Jiang}[0m emphasized that there are two goals [1m[33m{China}[0m is seeking on [3m[33m{this issue}[0m : to maintain the peace and stability of [31m{the Korean Peninsula}[0m and to realize a non-nuclear region in [31m{the Korean Peninsula}[0m . 
(32) [33m{He}[0m said that " [1m[33m{China}[0m has always advocated resolution through direct talks between relevant sides . 
(33) [1m[33m{We}[0m welcome the preliminary results achieved by the talks between the US and [1m[31m{North Korea}[0m , and have been playing an active role . " 
(34) When answering the question on whether [1m[33m{China 's government}[0m is hoping for contact with [4m[33m{each country in Europe}[0m , or wants to have contact with [32m{the European Union}[0m , [33m{Zemin Jiang}[0m said that " [1m[33m{China}[0m is willing to have contact with [4m[33m{each country in Europe}[0m and also develop friendly co-operative relations with [32m{the European Union}[0m . 
(35) [33m{I}[0m think that these two are mutually exclusive . " 
(36) When a reporter asked to what level contacts with [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m could be extended by a country that maintains diplomatic relations with [1m[33m{China}[0m , [33m{Zemin Jiang}[0m emphasized that [4m[36m{all countries that have established diplomatic relations with China}[0m have expressed [4m[36m{their}[0m admission that [4m[34m{the People 's Republic of China}[0m is the only legal government representing [4m[34m{all of China}[0m , and that [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m is an inseparable part of [4m[34m{China}[0m . 
(37) [4m[36m{They}[0m promised not to establish official relations or have contact with [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m that is of an official nature . 
(38) [33m{He}[0m said that [1m[33m{we}[0m have no objections to economic and trade relations kept between [34m{France}[0m and [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m that are purely people - to - people .
