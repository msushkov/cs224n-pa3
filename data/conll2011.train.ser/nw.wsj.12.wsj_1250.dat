(6) Election analysts acknowledge that a `` Red - Green '' coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out [4m[31m{Chancellor Kohl 's}[0m coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for [4m[32m{the Republicans}[0m continues to spread . 
(7) International investigators urged [1m[35m{Britain}[0m to allow prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals who took refuge there after 1945 . 
(8) Under [32m{current law}[0m , such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not British citizens . 
(9) `` If [1m[35m{we}[0m 're not careful [1m[35m{we}[0m could become known as a haven for war criminals , '' said Jeff Rooker , a member of [3m[34m{Parliament}[0m and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from [3m[33m{the U.S.}[0m , Canada and Australia .

(14) [3m[36m{China}[0m had refused to repatriate citizens who sneaked into [1m[32m{Hong Kong}[0m illegally since early this month , when [1m[32m{the colony}[0m allowed a dissident Chinese swimmer to flee to [3m[33m{the U.S.}[0m .
