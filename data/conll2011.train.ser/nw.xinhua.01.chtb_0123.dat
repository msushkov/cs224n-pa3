(1) [1m[36m{The president of the People 's Bank of China , Xianglong Dai}[0m said , [1m[35m{China}[0m would continue to implement financial policies open to the outside . 
(2) [1m[36m{Xianglong Dai}[0m emphasized at the national and foreign reporter news press conference held [3m[31m{today}[0m that , [1m[35m{China}[0m would not give up on financial policies open to the outside because of financial turmoil occurring in some countries in [1m[34m{Southeast Asia}[0m . 
(3) [1m[36m{He}[0m said , another group of foreign banks and insurance companies had established branch institutions in [1m[35m{China}[0m last year , and that by year end , the number of business oriented financial institutions established in [1m[35m{China}[0m with foreign capital had reached more than 170 . 
(4) Henceforth , the number of branch institutions of foreign banks and insurance companies in [1m[35m{China}[0m would also suitably increase , and at the same time would also prepare to expand experimentation of foreign banks handling RMB business . 
(5) At the same time , [1m[36m{he}[0m also emphasized that , henceforth , more careful management of conditions of [1m[33m{foreign financial institutions}[0m ' applications to operate business in [1m[35m{China}[0m and qualifications of senior staff , and the legality of [1m[33m{their}[0m businesses would be implemented . 
(6) [1m[36m{He}[0m said , as there never was a schedule for exchangeability under RMB capital projects , therefore the process of delaying the process due to the Southeast Asian financial crisis does not exist . 
(7) However , in the area of opening up capital projects , the lessons learned from the financial crisis in [1m[34m{Southeast Asia}[0m will be assimilated , and a more careful attitude will be adopted .
