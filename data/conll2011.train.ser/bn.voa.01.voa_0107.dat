(0) [4m[35m{The Legend of Bagger Vance directed by Robert Redford}[0m is the latest movie to bring the game of golf to the screen and is one of the most popular attractions of theaters in the United States . 
(1) [4m[36m{Entertainment reporter Chuck Rich}[0m discussed [4m[35m{this}[0m and previous golf films with [4m[33m{VOA 's Dave Arlington}[0m . 
(2) The movies ' The Natural ' and ' Field of Dreams ' brought mystical and nostalgic qualities to baseball and [4m[35m{The Legend of Bagger Vance , set during the economic depression over the 1920s and 1930s ,}[0m does the same thing for golf . 
(3) [3m[36m{Will Smith}[0m plays a caddy who revives the confidence , as well as the skill of a golfer whose glory has faded . 
(4) You know [4m[33m{I}[0m understood everything [3m[36m{Will Smith}[0m said in films like '' Men in Black '' and '' Independence Day . '' 
(5) What was [3m[36m{he}[0m talking about there ? 
(6) Beats the heck out of [4m[36m{me}[0m . 
(7) Seriously , [4m[36m{I}[0m think [34m{golf and many golf films}[0m can be whatever you interpret [34m{them}[0m to be , what the player or the moviegoer decides [34m{they}[0m 'll be . 
(8) Some people consider [1m[36m{golf}[0m to be a silly and dull game , following a little ball around the course , others , including some filmmakers , view [1m[36m{it}[0m as a symbol or as a gauge of a person 's philosophy or psychology . 
(9) For example in the 1996 movie '' Tin Cup '' with Kevin Costner and Cheech Merrin , what might be an embarrassing experience in [35m{one golfer 's}[0m past is for [35m{him}[0m a badge of honor . 
(10) Do you have to [4m[32m{like}[0m golf to like golf movies ? 
(11) [4m[32m{It}[0m helps , but [4m[32m{it}[0m 's not necessary . 
(12) Some filmmakers and performers used [3m[35m{golf}[0m as a setting for broad comedy with potential appeal both inside and outside of [3m[35m{the sport}[0m . 
(13) [3m[34m{The 1996 golf movie '' Happy Gilmore '' starring and co-written by Adam Sandler}[0m , placed the temperamental ice hockey player in a professional sport that some people consider refined . 
(14) Golf can be a very frustrating game . 
(15) So , any golfer [4m[33m{I}[0m guess would understand that gag in [3m[34m{'' Happy Gilmore}[0m . '' 
(16) And anyone who dislikes or is bored by [33m{golf}[0m , might appreciate seeing [33m{the game}[0m played for laughs there . 
(17) What is [4m[36m{your}[0m take on golf movies ? 
(18) [4m[36m{I}[0m only play miniature golf and [4m[36m{I}[0m do n't watch golf on television . 
(19) [4m[36m{I}[0m think [4m[36m{I}[0m am one of the people [3m[32m{filmmakers}[0m are thinking of , when [3m[32m{they}[0m try to give a golf movie wide appeal , humor , or a love story for example . 
(20) [4m[34m{One film that 's attracted a lot of golf loving fans over the years}[0m is 1980 's '' Caddy Shack '' . 
(21) Set at the exclusive Bush Wood country club , [4m[34m{it}[0m 's about [3m[31m{class conflict}[0m or as movie advertising sometimes calls [3m[31m{it}[0m , [3m[31m{the snobs versus the flops}[0m . 
(22) Here is one golfer in [4m[34m{'' Caddy Shack ''}[0m played by [32m{Rodney Dangerfield}[0m , bothering another , a judge played by the late Ted Night . 
(23) As a comedian , [32m{Rodney Dangerfield}[0m often says [32m{he}[0m gets no respect , but were n't [3m[33m{the filmmakers}[0m really showing [3m[33m{their}[0m respect for [32m{him}[0m and [32m{his}[0m drawing power by casting [32m{him}[0m in [4m[34m{this film}[0m ? 
(24) [4m[36m{I}[0m think [32m{Dangerfield}[0m was a big selling point who attracted a lot of [32m{his}[0m fans , who include [4m[36m{me}[0m , to see '' [4m[34m{Caddy Shack}[0m . '' 
(25) [4m[36m{I}[0m do n't think [4m[34m{it}[0m 's a very good film , but [4m[34m{it}[0m 's a popular one and [4m[31m{the music in '' Caddy Shack ''}[0m got some attention too . 
(26) [31m{We}[0m 're going to finish up [31m{our}[0m cinematic round of golf with some of [4m[31m{that}[0m . 
(27) Thank [4m[36m{you}[0m , [4m[36m{Chuck}[0m . 
(28) [4m[33m{You}[0m 're welcome , [4m[33m{Dave}[0m .
