(0) [1m[36m{Bob Stone}[0m stewed over a letter from [1m[36m{his}[0m manager [1m[34m{putting}[0m [1m[36m{him}[0m on [35m{probation}[0m for insubordination . 
(1) [1m[36m{Mr. Stone}[0m thought [35m{the discipline}[0m was unfair ; [1m[36m{he}[0m believed that [1m[36m{his}[0m manager wanted to get rid of [1m[36m{him}[0m for personal reasons . 
(2) Unable to persuade [3m[34m{the manager}[0m to change [3m[34m{his}[0m decision , [1m[36m{he}[0m went to [1m[33m{a `` company court ''}[0m for a hearing . 
(3) At the scheduled time , [1m[36m{Mr. Stone}[0m entered a conference room in a building near where [1m[36m{he}[0m worked . 
(4) After [4m[34m{the three members of the court}[0m introduced [4m[34m{themselves}[0m , [4m[36m{the chairman of the panel}[0m said : `` Go ahead and tell [1m[33m{us}[0m what happened . 
(5) [1m[33m{We}[0m may ask questions as you go along , or [1m[33m{we}[0m may wait until the end . '' 
(6) No lawyers or tape recorders were present . 
(7) The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists , one of whom knew [1m[36m{Mr. Stone 's}[0m case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give [1m[33m{the court}[0m the full picture . 
(8) Over a cup of coffee , [1m[36m{Mr. Stone}[0m told [1m[36m{his}[0m story . 
(9) [1m[36m{He}[0m talked about 20 minutes . 
(10) When [1m[36m{he}[0m was through , [4m[34m{the court members}[0m asked many questions , then the [4m[36m{chairman}[0m said [4m[34m{they}[0m would like to hear [1m[36m{his}[0m manager 's side and talk to witnesses . 
(11) [4m[36m{The chairman}[0m promised [1m[36m{Mr. Stone}[0m a decision within two weeks . 
(12) [1m[36m{Bob Stone}[0m is a fictional name , but [1m[31m{the incident described}[0m is real . 
(13) [1m[31m{It}[0m happened at Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles . 
(14) [1m[33m{The court}[0m is called the Management Appeals Committee , or just `` MAC , '' and [1m[33m{it}[0m is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year . 
(15) Alter some details of [1m[31m{this example}[0m and [1m[31m{it}[0m could be taking place today at [3m[35m{Federal Express in Memphis , the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis , a General Electric plant in Columbia , Md. , or a number of other companies}[0m . 
(16) [3m[35m{These firms}[0m are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what [3m[36m{I}[0m call corporate due process . 
(17) Although [36m{corporate due process}[0m is practiced today in few companies -- perhaps 40 to 60 -- [36m{it}[0m is one of the fastest developing trends in industry . 
(18) In the coming decade a majority of people - oriented companies are likely to adopt [36m{it}[0m . 
(19) [32m{Corporate due process}[0m appeals to management for a variety of reasons . 
(20) [32m{It}[0m reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees , with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations . 
(21) [32m{It}[0m helps to keep out unions . 
(22) [32m{It}[0m increases employee commitment to the company , with all that means for efficiency and quality control . 
(23) What must your management team do to establish corporate due process ? 
(24) Here are four key steps : 
(25) 1 . Make sure you have [4m[31m{a strong personnel department}[0m . 
(26) [4m[31m{It}[0m must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates , else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases . 
(27) At Polaroid , the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year ; the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages . 
(28) At TWA , the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year , only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists . 
(29) At Citicorp , the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel 's skill in complaint - resolution . 
(30) In a typical year , up to 20 % of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment . 
(31) In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle . 
(32) 2 . Formally or informally , train [1m[36m{all your managers and supervisors}[0m in [1m[32m{the company 's}[0m due - process approach . 
(33) See that [1m[36m{they}[0m know [1m[35m{company personnel policy}[0m backwards and forwards , for [1m[35m{it}[0m is the `` law '' governing company courts and adjudicators . 
(34) Coach [1m[36m{them}[0m in handling complaints so that [1m[36m{they}[0m can resolve problems immediately . 
(35) In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and [1m[34m{subordinates}[0m take [1m[34m{their}[0m complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept [31m{reversals}[0m as a fact of business life , for in a good due - process system [31m{they}[0m are bound to happen . 
(36) In the 15 companies [3m[36m{I}[0m studied , reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 % . 
(37) 3 . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator . 
(38) A panel system like that [1m[33m{in the Bob Stone example}[0m enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support . 
(39) An adjudicator system -- that is , an investigator who acts first as a fact - finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy . 
(40) [1m[35m{International Business Machines}[0m and Bank of America are among the companies using the single - adjudicator approach . 
(41) 4 . Make [3m[33m{your due - process system}[0m visible . 
(42) [3m[33m{It}[0m wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about [3m[33m{it}[0m . 
(43) [3m[32m{Most managements}[0m hesitate to go all out in advertising [3m[32m{their}[0m due - process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . 
(44) On the other hand , [3m[32m{they}[0m make sure at a minimum that [3m[32m{their}[0m systems are described in [3m[32m{their}[0m employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists . 
(45) [4m[32m{Smith - Kline Beecham}[0m goes further and sometimes features [4m[32m{its}[0m grievance procedure in closed - circuit TV programs . 
(46) Naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for [3m[31m{your due - process system}[0m is for top management to [4m[33m{support}[0m [3m[31m{it}[0m . 
(47) At [1m[35m{IBM}[0m , [1m[35m{the company 's}[0m Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive . 
(48) [34m{Federal Express}[0m goes further in this [4m[33m{respect}[0m than any company [3m[36m{I}[0m know of with [33m{both Frederick Smith}[0m and [4m[35m{James Barksdale}[0m , [33m{chief executive}[0m and [4m[35m{chief operating officer}[0m , respectively , sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases . 
(49) [3m[36m{Mr. Ewing}[0m is a consultant based in Winchester , Mass. , and author of `` Justice on the Job : Resolving Grievances in the Nonunion Workplace '' -LRB- Harvard Business School Press , 1989 -RRB- .
