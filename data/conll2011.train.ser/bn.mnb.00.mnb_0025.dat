(0) [3m[31m{We}[0m have an update [3m[33m{tonight}[0m on [35m{this , the volcano in Mexico , they call El Popo}[0m . 
(1) Just 24 hours after [35m{its}[0m first erruption in more than 1,000 years , the worst appears to be over , but there is still the possibility of great danger to the tens of thousands of people who live nearby . 
(2) [3m[31m{Our}[0m report on this [3m[33m{tonight}[0m from Kevin Tibbles . 
(3) As the sun rises over [35m{Mt. Popo}[0m [3m[33m{tonight}[0m , the only hint of the fire storm inside , whiffs of smoke , but just a few hours earlier , [35m{the volcano}[0m exploding spewing rock and red - hot lava . 
(4) [35m{The fourth largest mountain in North American , nearly 18,000 feet high}[0m , [3m[35m{erupting}[0m this week with [35m{its}[0m most violent outburst in [1m[31m{1200 years}[0m . 
(5) They say [35m{it}[0m is an especially dangerous volcano because of [35m{its}[0m steep slopes . 
(6) [35m{It}[0m could potentially wipe out everything in [35m{its}[0m path . 
(7) 40,000 people live in [1m[33m{the path}[0m . 
(8) Here at [3m[34m{the National Natural Disaster Prevention Center}[0m , [3m[34m{they}[0m are working around the clock . 
(9) It is here [3m[34m{they}[0m take [35m{the volcano 's}[0m pulse , calling [35m{it}[0m unstable , saying [35m{Popo}[0m is simply recharging , getting ready to erupt again . 
(10) [35m{It}[0m 's acquiring [1m[36m{more pressure}[0m , and eventually [1m[36m{this pressure}[0m will be released in the future days . 
(11) The danger ? 
(12) The heat from [35m{Popo 's}[0m lava flow is melting the glaciers on the sides of [35m{the mountain}[0m and could trigger [1m[34m{mud slides}[0m . 
(13) It 's like concrete coming down instead of water . 
(14) So , [1m[34m{they}[0m will destroy anything that tries to stop [1m[34m{them}[0m . 
(15) [36m{The Mexican government}[0m is taking no chances . 
(16) [36m{It}[0m sent out 1,000 troops to force an evacuation inside an eight - mile radius . 
(17) [3m[33m{Tonight}[0m , 20,000 people in shelters , but [1m[32m{another 20,000}[0m refuse to leave , worried about [1m[32m{their}[0m corn harvests or who would feed [1m[32m{their}[0m animals . 
(18) If a major danger was to come , says this man , then we 've got to run . 
(19) There 's no other choice . 
(20) Scientists say [35m{Popo}[0m has a huge crater about half a mile across , about 300 feet deep and a lava dome is building up like an upside - down grapefruit . 
(21) In contrast , [3m[32m{Mt. Saint Helen}[0m had a dome , almost as if [3m[32m{it}[0m was pregnant . 
(22) Randy White , who has done on - site studies of [35m{this mountain}[0m , monitors the rhythms . 
(23) [35m{It}[0m is blowing in [35m{its}[0m own way . 
(24) [35m{It}[0m could get bigger . 
(25) We do n't know how to predict it exactly . 
(26) For centuries here , [1m[35m{the people}[0m have had almost a mystical relationship with [35m{Popo}[0m , believing [35m{the volcano}[0m is a god , showering [1m[35m{their}[0m crops with rain . 
(27) [3m[33m{Tonight}[0m , [1m[35m{they}[0m fear [35m{it}[0m will turn vengeful , bringing destruction after [1m[31m{1200 years of peace}[0m .
