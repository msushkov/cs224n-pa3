(0) Christopher Cox 's Oct. 13 editorial - page article `` Toward More Crippling Lawsuits ... '' misses the point . 
(1) [1m[35m{The 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act}[0m is about eliminating discriminatory barriers . 
(2) When [1m[33m{we}[0m look closely at [1m[33m{our}[0m own history , it is clear that [1m[33m{our}[0m constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people 's hearts but through [1m[32m{legislation and constitutional amendments}[0m . 
(3) [1m[32m{This}[0m is how American women won the right to vote . 
(4) And [1m[32m{it}[0m is how [3m[31m{African - Americans and other minority groups}[0m were guaranteed [3m[31m{their}[0m equal rights as citizens in [1m[33m{this nation}[0m . 
(5) For [1m[34m{the more than 43 million Americans with disabilities}[0m , [1m[35m{the 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act}[0m provides the missing piece . 
(6) [1m[34m{Disabled Americans}[0m have had [1m[34m{their}[0m civil rights [1m[36m{guaranteed}[0m in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed as a part of [1m[31m{the 1973 Rehabilitation Act}[0m . 
(7) [1m[35m{The 1989 act}[0m simply extends [1m[36m{these guarantees}[0m to the private sector . 
(8) Those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on [1m[31m{the Rehabilitation Act}[0m . 
(9) Without legal recourse , there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone .
