(1) [3m[35m{Reverend Jackson}[0m , we heard a report earlier this evening that the Vice President had dispatched [3m[35m{you}[0m , or at least invited [3m[35m{you}[0m to help in the Get Out the Vote effort [3m[36m{tonight}[0m . 
(2) Is that true ? 
(3) Well , not just tonight . 
(4) Over the last few months gone about 50 stops around the country . 
(5) We did massive voter registration , then Get Out the Vote efforts . 
(6) [3m[35m{I}[0m think we were along with the NAACP and others , worked on the Get your Souls to the Polls on the one hand and on the other hand Stay out of the Bushes and it worked . 
(7) Do [3m[35m{you}[0m know anything we do n't know , because so far we have [1m[35m{a tight race here}[0m ? 
(8) [1m[35m{A tight race}[0m but fact of the matter is that [4m[31m{Jeb Bush 's}[0m anti-affirmative action action in [3m[31m{Florida}[0m solidified women and people of color and basically we won [3m[31m{Florida}[0m , thanks to [4m[31m{Jeb Bush}[0m . 
(9) Our vote in [1m[36m{Michigan}[0m , we have done about 10 days of solid work across [1m[36m{Michigan}[0m . 
(10) Workers fighting for right to organize and women fighting for -- and blacks together . 
(11) [3m[35m{I}[0m think when [3m[33m{Bush}[0m made it clear that [3m[33m{he}[0m wants a strict constructionist court led by Scalia , attacked affirmative action , attack of women 's rights , point this strong ideological line is shown in these vote totals tonight so far . 
(12) [3m[35m{Reverend Jackson}[0m , it 's going to be said , however late we 're at this [3m[36m{tonight}[0m , and whoever [3m[32m{wins}[0m it , that [3m[32m{it}[0m 's going to be so thin , so narrow , that [3m[32m{it}[0m will be a victory without mandate . 
(13) Well , [3m[35m{I}[0m think what it means is that we must then deal with some consensus issues . 
(14) For example , should there not be a consensus that Social Security should be kept secure and not risked in the marketplace ? 
(15) Should [1m[33m{we}[0m not make a commitment to educate all of [1m[33m{our}[0m children , not just vouchers for a few of [1m[34m{them}[0m ?
