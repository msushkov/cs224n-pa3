(0) FOR THOSE WHO DELIGHT in the misfortune of others , read on . 
(1) This is a story about suckers . 
(2) Most of [33m{us}[0m know a sucker . 
(3) Many of [33m{us}[0m are suckers . 
(4) But what [33m{we}[0m may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker . 
(5) What makes [4m[35m{people}[0m blurt out [4m[35m{their}[0m credit - card numbers to a caller [4m[35m{they}[0m 've never heard of ? 
(6) Do [4m[35m{they}[0m really believe that [34m{the number}[0m is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand - prize winner ? 
(7) What makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door ? 
(8) Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off , once it is built ? 
(9) Because in the end , [1m[33m{these people}[0m always wind up asking [1m[33m{themselves}[0m [35m{the same question : `` How could I be so stupid}[0m ? '' 
(10) There are , unfortunately , plenty of [4m[36m{answers to that question}[0m -- and [4m[34m{scam artists}[0m know all of [4m[36m{them}[0m . 
(11) `` [4m[34m{These people}[0m are very skilled at finding out what makes [36m{a person}[0m tick , '' says Kent Neal , chief of the economic - crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale , [1m[35m{Fla.}[0m , a major haven for boiler rooms . 
(12) `` Once [4m[34m{they}[0m size [36m{them}[0m up , then [4m[34m{they}[0m know what buttons to push . '' 
(13) [1m[31m{John Blodgett}[0m agrees -- and [1m[31m{he}[0m ought to know . 
(14) [1m[31m{He}[0m used to be a boiler - room salesman , peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins . 
(15) `` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways , '' [1m[31m{he}[0m says . 
(16) The most obvious pitch , of course , is the lure of big returns . 
(17) `` [3m[34m{We}[0m 're all a little greedy . 
(18) [3m[34m{Everyone}[0m is vulnerable , '' says Charles Harper , associate regional administrator for [1m[31m{the Securities and Exchange Commission}[0m in Miami . 
(19) `` [4m[34m{These guys}[0m prey on human frailties . '' 
(20) While [1m[32m{the promises of big profits}[0m ought to set off warning bells , [1m[32m{they}[0m often do n't , in part because get - rich - quick tales have become embedded in American folklore . 
(21) `` [31m{The overnight success story}[0m is part of [4m[33m{our}[0m culture , and [4m[33m{our}[0m society puts an emphasis on [31m{it}[0m with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says [4m[31m{Michael Cunningham , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville}[0m . 
(22) `` Other people are making it overnight , and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss [1m[35m{that opportunity}[0m when [1m[35m{it}[0m seems to come along . '' 
(23) Adds Spencer Barasch , branch chief for enforcement at [1m[31m{the SEC}[0m in Fort Worth , Texas : `` Why do [3m[35m{people}[0m play the lottery when the odds are great against [3m[35m{them}[0m ? 
(24) People are shooting for a dream . '' 
(25) Clearly , though , scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions ; the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy . 
(26) There 's also , for instance , the need to be part of the in - crowd . 
(27) So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing . 
(28) Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , [32m{SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. ,}[0m sold interests in [1m[33m{oil wells}[0m to a very select group of local residents , while turning away numerous other eager investors . 
(29) [3m[33m{The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges ,}[0m confided to investors that [3m[33m{he}[0m had [1m[34m{a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co.}[0m and said the location of [3m[33m{his}[0m wells was confidential , according to [36m{a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office}[0m . 
(30) Neither [1m[34m{the Amoco agreement}[0m nor [1m[33m{the wells}[0m existed , [36m{the suit}[0m alleged . 
(31) Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial - crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to [35m{investors}[0m ' `` desire to believe [1m[36m{this}[0m is really true and that [35m{they}[0m are part of a chosen group being given [1m[36m{this opportunity}[0m . '' 
(32) At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says [4m[31m{Mr. Cunningham}[0m . 
(33) In [4m[36m{appealing}[0m to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , [4m[36m{the fraud artist}[0m can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating [4m[36m{himself}[0m from being discovered and keeping [4m[36m{his}[0m victim from consulting with others . 
(34) [4m[36m{It}[0m also adds to the mystery of the venture . 
(35) [1m[31m{Mr. Blodgett , the boiler - room veteran ,}[0m believes that for many investors , the get - rich - quick scams carry a longed - for element of excitement . 
(36) `` Once [33m{people}[0m got into [4m[35m{it}[0m , [1m[31m{I}[0m was allowing [33m{them}[0m to live a dream , '' [1m[31m{he}[0m says . 
(37) [1m[31m{He}[0m phoned [33m{them}[0m with updates on [4m[35m{the investment}[0m , such as `` funny things that happened at the well that week , '' [1m[31m{he}[0m says . 
(38) `` You gave [33m{them}[0m some excitement that [33m{they}[0m did n't have in [33m{their}[0m lives . '' 
(39) -LRB- [1m[31m{Mr. Blodgett , who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive ,}[0m is now on probation . 
(40) [1m[31m{He}[0m says [1m[31m{he}[0m has quit the business and is back in school , majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology . -RRB- 
(41) For [1m[33m{some investors}[0m , it 's the appearances that leave [1m[33m{them}[0m deceived . 
(42) `` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says [4m[34m{Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard}[0m . 
(43) Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment . 
(44) `` [1m[32m{People}[0m honestly lose money on risky investments that [1m[32m{they}[0m did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' [4m[34m{he}[0m says . 
(45) [3m[35m{Paul Wenz , a Phoenix , Ariz. , attorney ,}[0m says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made [3m[35m{him}[0m leery . 
(46) But [3m[35m{Mr. Wenz , who says he lost $ 43,000 in one precious - metals deal and $ 39,000 in another ,}[0m says a salesman `` used a business - venture approach '' with [3m[35m{him}[0m , sending investment literature , a contract limiting [34m{the firm 's}[0m liability , and an insurance policy . 
(47) When [3m[35m{he}[0m visited [34m{the company 's}[0m office , [3m[35m{he}[0m says , [3m[36m{it}[0m had `` all the trappings of legitimacy . '' 
(48) Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good , says Douglas Watson , commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko - forgery division . 
(49) Born - again Christians are the most visible targets of [33m{unscrupulous do - gooder investment pitches}[0m . 
(50) But hardly the only ones : [33m{The scams}[0m promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children . 
(51) Psychologists say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud . 
(52) [1m[34m{Scam artists}[0m seek out such people -- or try to make sure that [1m[34m{their}[0m victims isolate [3m[36m{themselves}[0m . 
(53) For instance , salesmen may counter [4m[35m{a man 's}[0m objection that [4m[35m{he}[0m wants to discuss an investment with [4m[35m{his}[0m wife by asking , `` Who wears the pants in [4m[35m{your}[0m family ? '' 
(54) Or [1m[36m{an investor who wants his accountant 's advice}[0m may be told , `` [1m[36m{You}[0m seem like a guy who can make up his own mind . '' 
(55) Often [1m[31m{con artists}[0m will try to disarm [1m[31m{their}[0m victims by emphasizing similarities between them . 
(56) [36m{William Lynes , a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. ,}[0m says [36m{he}[0m and [36m{his}[0m wife , Lily , warmed to the investment pitches of [31m{a penny - stock peddler from Stuart - James Co. in Atlanta}[0m after [31m{the broker}[0m told [3m[33m{them}[0m [31m{he}[0m , too , had once worked with [1m[35m{Lockheed}[0m . 
(57) [3m[33m{The Lyneses , of Powder Springs , Ga. ,}[0m have filed suit in [4m[31m{Georgia}[0m state court against [4m[32m{Stuart James}[0m , [35m{alleging}[0m fraud . 
(58) [3m[33m{They}[0m are awaiting an arbitration proceeding . 
(59) [3m[33m{They}[0m say [31m{the broker}[0m took [3m[33m{them}[0m out for lunch frequently . 
(60) [31m{He}[0m urged [3m[33m{them}[0m to refer [3m[33m{their}[0m friends , who also lost money . 
(61) -LRB- Donald Trinen , an attorney for [4m[32m{the penny - brokerage firm}[0m , denies [35m{the fraud allegations}[0m and says [3m[33m{the Lyneses}[0m were fully apprised that [3m[33m{they}[0m were pursuing a high - risk investment . -RRB- 
(62) `` It 's not uncommon for [1m[32m{these guys}[0m to send pictures of [1m[32m{themselves}[0m or [1m[32m{their}[0m families to ingratiate [1m[32m{themselves}[0m to [1m[32m{their}[0m clients , '' says Terree Bowers , chief of [3m[31m{the major - frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles}[0m . 
(63) `` [3m[31m{We}[0m 've seen cases where [4m[32m{salesmen}[0m will affect the accent of the region of [4m[33m{the country}[0m [4m[32m{they}[0m are calling . 
(64) Anything to make a sale . '' 
(65) Experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point , timing is crucial . 
(66) [3m[34m{People}[0m may be particularly vulnerable to flim - flam pitches when [3m[34m{they}[0m are in the midst of a major upheaval in [3m[34m{their}[0m lives . 
(67) `` Sometimes when [3m[31m{people}[0m are making big changes , retiring from [3m[31m{their}[0m jobs , moving to a new area , [3m[31m{they}[0m lose [3m[31m{their}[0m bearings , '' says Maury Elvekrog , a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger - Elvekrog Inc. , a Birmingham , Mich. , investment - counseling firm . 
(68) `` [3m[31m{They}[0m may be susceptible to [32m{some song and dance}[0m if [32m{it}[0m hits [3m[31m{them}[0m at the right time . '' 
(69) [3m[31m{They}[0m are obviously also more susceptible when [3m[31m{they}[0m need money - retirees , for instance , trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses . 
(70) `` [3m[31m{These people}[0m are n't necessarily stupid or naive . 
(71) Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way , '' says Jerald Jellison , a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in [3m[32m{Los Angeles}[0m . 
(72) [34m{Nick Cortese}[0m thinks that 's what happened to [34m{him}[0m . 
(73) [34m{Mr. Cortese , a 33 - year - old Delta Air Lines engineer ,}[0m [31m{invested}[0m some $ 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns . 
(74) `` [4m[33m{We}[0m were saving up to buy a house , and [34m{my}[0m wife was pregnant , '' says [34m{Mr. Cortese}[0m . 
(75) `` [3m[32m{It}[0m was just before the Christmas holidays , and [34m{I}[0m figured [4m[33m{we}[0m could use some extra cash . '' 
(76) The investment is worth about $ 130 today . 
(77) `` Maybe [3m[32m{it}[0m was just a vulnerable time , '' says [34m{Mr. Cortese}[0m . 
(78) `` Maybe the next day or even an hour later , [34m{I}[0m would n't have done [31m{it}[0m . '' 
(79) Ms. Brannigan is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's [32m{Atlanta}[0m bureau .
