(0) Freight rates , declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation , are bottoming out , [1m[33m{turning}[0m upward and threatening to fuel inflation . 
(1) Trucking , shipping and air - freight companies have announced [1m[33m{rate increases , scheduled for this fall or early next year , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport}[0m . 
(2) [1m[35m{Major shippers}[0m say [1m[35m{they}[0m [4m[35m{expect}[0m freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years . 
(3) [4m[35m{That}[0m 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad . 
(4) `` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said Clifford Sayre , director of logistics at Du Pont Co . 
(5) [1m[34m{Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University}[0m said [1m[34m{they}[0m expect [1m[34m{their}[0m freight - transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % [33m{this year}[0m . 
(6) [4m[34m{Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled}[0m expected [4m[34m{their}[0m freight - transport costs to decrease , compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years . 
(7) `` [33m{This}[0m is the first year since transportation deregulation in [3m[33m{1980}[0m that [4m[32m{we}[0m have had such a dramatic and broad - based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said [31m{Bernard LaLonde , a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus}[0m . 
(8) The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in [3m[33m{1980}[0m enabled shippers to bargain for transportation . 
(9) [3m[35m{Carriers}[0m could use [3m[35m{their}[0m equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity [3m[35m{they}[0m were eager to fill . 
(10) [32m{Shippers}[0m cut about $ 35 billion from [32m{their}[0m annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 . 
(11) But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight - transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates . 
(12) `` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said [31m{Mr. LaLonde}[0m . 
(13) `` [1m[32m{Shippers}[0m wo n't be able to look for transportation - cost savings as [1m[32m{they}[0m have for the last eight or nine years . 
(14) Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy . '' 
(15) Robert Delaney , a consultant at [3m[31m{Arthur D. Little Inc. , Cambridge , Mass.}[0m , said `` [3m[31m{We}[0m 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight - cost reductions . 
(16) Now [3m[31m{we}[0m are starting to see real freight - rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor . 
(17) You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . '' 
(18) Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers . 
(19) `` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said Gerard McCullough , lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 
(20) [4m[31m{Less - than - truckload companies , which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer ,}[0m discounted away a 4.7 % rate increase implemented last April . 
(21) [4m[31m{The carriers}[0m were competing fiercely for market share . 
(22) Railroad - rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail - traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks . 
(23) An official at [1m[31m{Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less - than - truckload carrier ,}[0m said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . '' 
(24) [1m[31m{Consolidated Freightways}[0m plans to raise [1m[31m{its}[0m rates 5.3 % late this year or [36m{early next year}[0m , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases . 
(25) [34m{Truckers}[0m are `` trying to send signals that [34m{they}[0m need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said [35m{Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros}[0m . 
(26) And `` [4m[33m{shippers}[0m are getting the feeling that [4m[33m{they}[0m have played one trucker off against another as much as [4m[33m{they}[0m can , '' [35m{he}[0m said . 
(27) [3m[36m{Air - freight carriers}[0m raised [3m[36m{their}[0m rates for U.S. products going across [3m[32m{the Pacific}[0m to [3m[32m{Asia}[0m by about 20 % earlier this month . 
(28) And [3m[31m{Japan Air Lines}[0m said [3m[31m{it}[0m plans to boost [3m[31m{its}[0m rates a further 25 % over the next two years . 
(29) Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air - freight - forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan . 
(30) [4m[36m{Ship companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore}[0m , have been able to increase [4m[36m{their}[0m rates in the last couple of years . 
(31) Some bulk shipping rates have increased `` 3 % to 4 % in the past few months , '' said [3m[34m{Salomon 's}[0m Mr. Lloyd . 
(32) And [1m[36m{ship lines carrying containers}[0m are also trying to raise [1m[36m{their}[0m rates . 
(33) Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels . 
(34) Ship lines operating in [3m[32m{the Pacific}[0m plan to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to [3m[32m{Asia}[0m about 10 % , effective next April .
