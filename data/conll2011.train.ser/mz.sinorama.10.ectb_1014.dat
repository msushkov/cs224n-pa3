(0) The " he 's one of us " effect 
(1) Few voters can see the significance of [3m[34m{this election}[0m for party politics . 
(2) In this atmosphere of choosing among " individual heroes " rather than parties , [1m[34m{voters}[0m are more [3m[31m{concerned}[0m about [3m[35m{the candidates '}[0m characters and deportment than [1m[34m{they}[0m are about [3m[35m{their}[0m policy views or party backgrounds . 
(3) [3m[31m{That}[0m is why [1m[32m{Soong , who early on was significantly ahead of his rivals in public opinion polls ,}[0m saw a dramatic drop in support after the Chung Hsing Bills scandal broke . 
(4) Meanwhile , newspapers and TV are filled with [3m[36m{negative advertising in which candidates sling mud at one another}[0m . 
(5) [3m[36m{These ads}[0m are giving voters the impression that [1m[33m{the nation 's}[0m future leaders are all " bad apples . " 
(6) This not only marks the deterioration of electoral culture , but is a serious blow to morale in the nation and society . 
(7) The effects may prove to be far - reaching . 
(8) [1m[31m{Chang Chun - hung}[0m adds that [4m[31m{negative election tactics , which after all may be seen in any democratic country ,}[0m are not - bad as [4m[31m{they}[0m are - the biggest threat . 
(9) [1m[31m{He}[0m says [1m[33m{Taiwan}[0m voters should most be on the lookout for the " one of us " effect . 
(10) [1m[36m{Mobilization of votes based on ethnicity or provincial origin}[0m is the cheapest route to victory . 
(11) [1m[36m{This}[0m has long been a tactic used in [1m[33m{Taiwan}[0m elections . 
(12) As a result , [1m[33m{Taiwan 's}[0m ethnic groups are pitted against one another politically . 
(13) [3m[33m{Lin Wen - cheng}[0m states that in terms of daily life , differences between [1m[33m{Taiwan 's}[0m ethnic groups have largely disappeared . 
(14) But , because ethnic cleavages are constantly being exploited in elections , inter-group political conflict remains serious . 
(15) [3m[33m{Lin}[0m contends : " It is inevitable that [3m[32m{minority groups in any society}[0m feel insecure about [3m[32m{their}[0m status . 
(16) In the last election for the mayor of Taipei , it was obvious that virtually all mainlanders voted for [4m[34m{Ma Ying - jeou}[0m . 
(17) Because [1m[35m{the majority Taiwanese}[0m do not feel threatened , [1m[35m{they}[0m were less likely to vote based on provincial origin , giving [4m[34m{Ma}[0m enough cross-over votes to beat out Chen Shui - bian . 
(18) In [3m[34m{this upcoming election}[0m , [1m[32m{James Soong [ who is a mainlander ]}[0m is also getting a lot of support from [4m[35m{Hakka}[0m people , who sympathize with [1m[32m{his}[0m outsider status and remember [1m[32m{his}[0m support for [4m[35m{Hakka}[0m identity . " 
(19) Unfortunately , however " natural " it is that minority groups feel insecure , exploitation of these cleavages for electoral gain can only have a negative long - term impact on society as a whole . 
(20) In the 2000 election , [1m[33m{Taiwan}[0m will not only be choosing a new leader . 
(21) [1m[33m{It}[0m will also be choosing a new direction for party politics , and will help decide future relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and between ethnic groups in [1m[33m{Taiwan}[0m . 
(22) How can [4m[32m{people}[0m make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? 
(23) How can [4m[32m{they}[0m monitor [4m[32m{their}[0m new leader to ensure that [1m[33m{Taiwan}[0m has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? 
(24) These are not only questions for [3m[34m{this election}[0m , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .
