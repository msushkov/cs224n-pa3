(0) Hello , I 'm Kathleen Kennedy , sitting in for Chuck Roberts . 
(1) [3m[31m{We}[0m begin this half hour with the latest developments in [34m{the presidential election}[0m . 
(2) [1m[33m{Thousands of disputed ballots in South Florida}[0m are being prepared for shipment to [4m[36m{the state capital}[0m amid tight security . 
(3) [31m{A Tallahassee judge}[0m wants [1m[33m{them}[0m in case [1m[33m{they}[0m are needed as evidence in a lawsuit challenging [3m[34m{Florida 's}[0m certified vote , but there are growing signs state lawmakers could step in and decide the winner . 
(4) [3m[36m{Jonathan Aiken}[0m reports . 
(5) State legislators in [3m[34m{Florida 's}[0m capitol are discussing if a special session is needed to decide which 25 electors will represent [3m[34m{Florida}[0m in [1m[35m{the Electoral College}[0m -- a Democratic slate ? or a Republican slate ? 
(6) U.S. law allows state legislatures to [36m{choose}[0m representatives to [1m[35m{the Electoral College}[0m as a last resort . 
(7) [3m[34m{Florida}[0m lawmakers may go [36m{that route}[0m , if [4m[35m{the disputed recount}[0m is n't settled by December six days before [1m[35m{the Electoral College}[0m meets to verify the results of [34m{the presidential election}[0m . 
(8) Experts are telling [3m[34m{Florida 's}[0m lawmakers to act cautiously . 
(9) The right to vote [3m[35m{is}[0m clearly protected by the First Amendment . 
(10) I think that your action needs to take [3m[35m{that}[0m into consideration . 
(11) As [32m{lawmakers}[0m consider [32m{their}[0m options , the legal fight over [4m[35m{the recount}[0m continues at several levels . 
(12) In Leon County , which includes [4m[36m{Tallahassee}[0m , [31m{Circuit Court Judge N. Sanders Sauls}[0m ordered [1m[33m{13,000 contested ballots from Miami - Dade and Palm Beach counties}[0m to be brought to [4m[36m{Tallahassee}[0m by [1m[31m{Saturday}[0m . 
(13) [1m[31m{That}[0m 's when [31m{he}[0m 'll decide if [1m[33m{they}[0m should be counted , along with contested ballots from Nassau County . 
(14) [4m[31m{Miami - Dade County , for one}[0m , is heavily Democratic , and it 's from these areas , [1m[32m{Gore}[0m officials believe , that a hand count of [1m[36m{ballots}[0m will turn up enough votes to overcome [35m{Governor Bush 's}[0m lead . 
(15) In West Palm Beach Wednesday , [4m[32m{an independent , conservative group called Judicial Watch}[0m asked a court to let [4m[32m{it}[0m see [1m[36m{those ballots}[0m for [4m[32m{itself}[0m . 
(16) [4m[32m{We}[0m 're here for [3m[32m{the public}[0m , for [3m[32m{the public}[0m should know what 's going on without two adversaries that are fighting with each other . 
(17) [4m[33m{The Gore camp}[0m would prefer the ballot counting from all disputed counties start immediately . 
(18) [4m[33m{It}[0m 's concerned [3m[32m{the public}[0m is losing patience with the legal challenges to the [3m[34m{Florida}[0m vote . 
(19) As [1m[34m{this host of legal actions}[0m makes [1m[34m{its}[0m way through the [3m[34m{Florida}[0m court system , attention is turning to the legal body of last resort in the United States -- the U.S. Supreme Court in [33m{Washington}[0m . 
(20) Oral arguments will be heard Friday on a request by the [35m{Bush}[0m campaign to overturn [4m[34m{a decision by Florida 's Supreme Court}[0m . 
(21) [3m[33m{It}[0m [4m[34m{ruled}[0m that recounts submitted to state officials after a filing deadline had passed had to be counted . 
(22) [3m[36m{Jonathan Aiken}[0m , for [3m[31m{CNN}[0m , [33m{Washington}[0m .
