(0) Welcome to another hour of news and information on [31m{The Voice of America}[0m . 
(1) I 'm David Chadwick with [31m{VOA}[0m News Now . 
(2) [1m[32m{President Clinton}[0m is criticizing [33m{a proposal to open up food and medicine sales to Cuba , but toughen restrictions on travel there}[0m . 
(3) [31m{VOA 's}[0m David Swan reports . 
(4) The House of Representatives is expected to vote on [33m{the measure}[0m next week . 
(5) [1m[32m{Mr. Clinton}[0m says [1m[32m{he}[0m will withhold final judgment until [1m[32m{he}[0m sees details of [33m{the plan , which Members of Congress hammered out Thursday night}[0m , but [1m[32m{he}[0m tells reporters that if [33m{the deal}[0m was what [33m{it}[0m appears to be , [32m{the lawmakers}[0m made a big mistake . 
(6) It looks like [33m{it}[0m eases the embargo on food and medicine , but [33m{it}[0m probably does n't very much because [33m{it}[0m does n't provide any financing credits , which we give to other poor countries , whereas [33m{it}[0m definitely restricts the ability of the executive branch to increase people - to - people contacts between Americans and Cubans . 
(7) [33m{The agreement which is part of a larger foreign bill}[0m , came after more than a year of political warfare and bargaining over the always sensitive subject of [36m{Cuba}[0m . 
(8) [33m{The measure}[0m would allow American food and medicine to be [35m{sold}[0m there for the first time in close to 40 years . 
(9) [33m{It}[0m also applies to four other nations where trade has been restricted , Iran , Sudan , Libya and North Korea , but Cuban - American House Members who fiercely oppose anything that might ease pressure on [1m[31m{President Castro}[0m demanded concessions . 
(10) So , as [1m[32m{Mr. Clinton}[0m noted , [33m{the plan}[0m bars American banks from financing the food sales , which means [36m{Havana}[0m would have to pay cash or obtain credits from third countries . 
(11) Another part of [33m{the legislation}[0m would tighten restrictions on American travel to [36m{Cuba}[0m . 
(12) [36m{The Castro government}[0m has already rejected [33m{the deal}[0m , saying [36m{it}[0m will not buy anything under these terms . 
(13) In contrast , the proposal supporters call [33m{it}[0m an opening to [36m{Cuba}[0m and an important shift in policy . 
(14) One leading farm group , the American Farm Bureau Federation describes [33m{it}[0m as a positive first step and much better than current law . 
(15) It appears [34m{Congress}[0m is not prepared to take any bigger steps on the issue this year . 
(16) [4m[36m{David Swan}[0m , [31m{VOA News}[0m , Capitol Hill .
