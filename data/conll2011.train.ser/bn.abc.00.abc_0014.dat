(0) Once again there 'll be two presidential candidates missing from the debate . 
(1) Pat Buchanan hardly registers on the political radar [3m[36m{this year}[0m . 
(2) And [32m{Ralph Nader , who may make the difference between a Gore or Bush win in several places}[0m . 
(3) [3m[35m{ABC 's}[0m Linda Douglas was with [32m{his}[0m campaign over the weekend . 
(4) [32m{Ralph Nader}[0m says [32m{his}[0m campaign is starting to take off . 
(5) Do [32m{you}[0m feel [3m[34m{momentum from last night}[0m ? 
(6) Yeah . 
(7) Well , [3m[34m{it}[0m was pretty big . 
(8) 7777 
(9) At a [32m{Nader}[0m rally in Madison Square Garden , 15,000 people joined actors Tim Robbins , Susan Sarandon and other stars to hear [32m{his}[0m message -- that [4m[34m{average Americans}[0m are powerless . 
(10) [4m[34m{They}[0m have lost control of [4m[34m{their}[0m government . 
(11) [4m[34m{They}[0m have lost control of [4m[34m{their}[0m workplace . 
(12) [32m{Nader}[0m condemns corporations , drug companies , pesticide manufacturers , banks , landlords , the media . 
(13) [32m{His}[0m supporters say [4m[32m{they}[0m do n't care that [32m{he}[0m has no chance to become [3m[33m{President}[0m . 
(14) [4m[31m{I}[0m want to see [4m[31m{my}[0m vote as a statement that [4m[31m{I}[0m will no longer compromise . 
(15) [32m{Nader}[0m says [4m[35m{George Bush and Al Gore}[0m are essentially corrupt . 
(16) Here 's [4m[33m{the difference between Bush and Gore}[0m when it comes to corporate power . 
(17) [4m[33m{It}[0m 's velocity with which [4m[35m{their}[0m knees hit the floor when corporations knock on [4m[35m{their}[0m doors . 
(18) Applause 
(19) In [3m[36m{a year when most candidates are afraid of appearing negative}[0m , [32m{Ralph Nader}[0m attacks [32m{his}[0m rivals with gusto . 
(20) [35m{George W. Bush}[0m is really a big corporation running for [3m[33m{President}[0m disguised as a human being . 
(21) But [32m{Nader}[0m is most critical of [34m{Al Gore}[0m , often when speaking to Democrats . 
(22) [34m{He}[0m has betrayed , [34m{he}[0m has lied , [34m{he}[0m has deceived , [34m{he}[0m has dissembled . 
(23) Democrats fear [32m{Nader}[0m may make a difference in some key states , like Washington and Wisconsin , luring voters away from [34m{Gore}[0m and handing [4m[36m{the election}[0m to [35m{Bush}[0m . 
(24) [32m{You}[0m know , [36m{some of the Democrats}[0m are going to blame [32m{you}[0m if [34m{Gore}[0m loses . 
(25) [36m{They}[0m ought to blame [36m{themselves}[0m . 
(26) Who do [32m{you}[0m think is going to win [3m[36m{this year}[0m ? 
(27) [32m{I}[0m do n't know . 
(28) [4m[36m{It}[0m 's very close . 
(29) Do [32m{you}[0m care ? 
(30) No . 
(31) [32m{He}[0m says [3m[36m{this year 's}[0m campaign is really about the next election , about building a serious third party and qualifying for federal campaign money . 
(32) Thanks for running . 
(33) Thanks for voting . 
(34) [32m{Nader}[0m is never happier than when [32m{he}[0m is taking on the system . 
(35) [33m{Linda Douglass}[0m , [3m[35m{ABC News}[0m , Piscataway , New Jersey .
