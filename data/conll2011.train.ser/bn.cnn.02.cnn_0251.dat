(0) That [36m{her}[0m younger sister , Mary Katherine , was the one who went to [33m{her}[0m father and said , `` [4m[36m{dad}[0m , [33m{I}[0m think [33m{I}[0m know who did this . '' 
(1) But it took some four months before they were able to get [35m{a picture}[0m and identify [35m{the picture}[0m as [1m[31m{this Brian David Mitchell and then his wife , Wanda Barzee}[0m . 
(2) The other questions , of course , are Why did n't [36m{Elizabeth Smart}[0m try to escape ? Were there opportunities perhaps that [36m{she}[0m might be able to get away from [36m{her}[0m abductors ? 
(3) The police are saying [36m{she}[0m was abducted by knife point and was an opportunity and may have been some kind of fear factor going on . 
(4) [34m{We}[0m are seeing a lot locally here some photographs that are coming out , that show [32m{Mitchell}[0m , [32m{his}[0m wife , and who they believe to be [36m{Elizabeth Smart}[0m at a party in September . 
(5) There were times perhaps [4m[35m{they}[0m were in a park somewhere in Salt Lake City completely robed in these veils and robes so you could not see [36m{her}[0m face . 
(6) There are a lot of [31m{questions coming out about why she could not get away from them , that remains to be answered}[0m . 
(7) The police are going to be holding a press conference later today . 
(8) [34m{We}[0m 're hoping to get more details about [31m{that}[0m .
