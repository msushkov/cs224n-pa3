(0) A smile and a tear 
(1) When [1m[33m{Huang}[0m writes of sad events , [1m[33m{his}[0m readers ' eyes really do fill with tears . 
(2) However , the most exceptional thing about [1m[33m{Huang}[0m as a writer is that [1m[33m{he}[0m is not satisfied with making [1m[33m{his}[0m readers cry . 
(3) [1m[33m{He}[0m wants every tear that falls to be accompanied by a small smile . 
(4) And [1m[33m{he}[0m is able to have it both ways because of the deep and tender sympathy of [1m[33m{his}[0m work . 
(5) The stories in [1m[32m{Letting Them Go}[0m are filled with [1m[34m{elderly characters}[0m . 
(6) Some are ignorant and suffer , like the old woman of " Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus . " 
(7) But [1m[31m{more of them}[0m are , like the protagonist of the " Irrational Old Man , " full of a wisdom unsuited to the times in which [1m[31m{they}[0m live . 
(8) [1m[31m{Their}[0m tragedy is that [1m[31m{they}[0m are out of step with the times , that [1m[31m{they}[0m do not know how to adapt to this cold and chaotic new society . 
(9) The comedy of [1m[31m{their}[0m predicament grows out of [1m[31m{their}[0m unwillingness to let go of [1m[35m{the " old " wisdom and " old " ways that they have treasured for so long}[0m , out of [1m[31m{their}[0m flaunting of [1m[35m{this " old " knowledge}[0m , and out of [1m[31m{their}[0m use of their " old " assumptions to guess [1m[31m{their}[0m way through the " new " world . 
(10) [1m[31m{Their}[0m guesses are all wrong , of course , but in [1m[31m{their}[0m creation of misunderstanding upon misunderstanding , we see a different kind of dignity . 
(11) And in [1m[35m{this " old " wisdom and these " old " ways}[0m , we also see a light that time can not dim . 
(12) Title : [1m[32m{Letting Them Go}[0m

(18) The rural elderly are the protagonists of [1m[32m{Letting Them Go}[0m . 
(19) [1m[33m{Huang 's}[0m characters bring both a smile to the lips , and a tear to the eye .
