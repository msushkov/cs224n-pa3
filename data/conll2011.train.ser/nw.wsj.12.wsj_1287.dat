(0) [1m[36m{International Business Machines Corp.}[0m unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that [1m[33m{manufacturers}[0m face when computerizing [1m[33m{their}[0m operations : Most machines ca n't talk to each other . 
(1) [1m[36m{The company}[0m unveiled more than 50 products , mostly software , that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation -- the plant floor , design operations and production planning . 
(2) The aim , ultimately , is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning , marketing and other operations . 
(3) [1m[35m{Manufacturers}[0m have already spent so heavily on automation that [1m[35m{they}[0m are one of the computer industry 's leading revenue sources . 
(4) But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines , including robots and machine tools . 
(5) [1m[36m{IBM 's}[0m announcement , which was expected and will formally be made to customers today , also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor , where Digital Equipment Corp. has long dominated and where Hewlett - Packard Co. has recently gained market share . 
(6) Consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the [1m[36m{IBM}[0m strategy to fall into place , even though the specific products [1m[36m{IBM}[0m unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter . 
(7) [1m[34m{Sam Albert , a consultant in Scarsdale , N.Y. ,}[0m said that in the past [1m[36m{IBM}[0m has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines . 
(8) [1m[34m{He}[0m said [1m[34m{he}[0m believes [1m[36m{IBM 's}[0m decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that [1m[36m{it}[0m was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology . 
(9) [1m[34m{He}[0m said [1m[34m{he}[0m expects [1m[36m{IBM}[0m to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months . 
(10) [1m[36m{IBM 's}[0m push is also unusual in [1m[36m{its}[0m approach to marketing . 
(11) Rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers ' doors , [1m[36m{IBM}[0m is making several hundred of [1m[36m{its}[0m own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs . 
(12) [1m[36m{IBM 's}[0m manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that [1m[36m{IBM}[0m has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems . 
(13) [1m[36m{IBM}[0m can obviously bring [1m[36m{its}[0m expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing , but [1m[36m{it}[0m could also help customers on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents . 
(14) `` [1m[36m{We}[0m may not have every manufacturing problem , but [1m[36m{we}[0m have most , '' said George Conrades , [1m[36m{IBM 's}[0m top marketing official .
