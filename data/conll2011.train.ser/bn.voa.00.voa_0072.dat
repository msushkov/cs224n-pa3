(0) Welcome to another hour of news and information on [31m{The Voice of America}[0m . 
(1) I 'm David Chadwick with [31m{VOA}[0m News now . 
(2) In what diplomats call a historic move , [32m{the United Nations General Assembly}[0m , Tuesday [1m[31m{approved}[0m [1m[34m{a resolution which was jointly sponsored by the governments of North Korea and South Korea}[0m . 
(3) [31m{VOA 's}[0m Breck Ardery reports from [4m[35m{the UN}[0m . 
(4) [1m[34m{The resolution}[0m hails last June 's summit meeting between the leaders of [34m{the two Koreas}[0m and encourages [34m{the two sides}[0m to lay a solid foundation for [1m[33m{the peaceful reunification of Korea}[0m . 
(5) [1m[34m{The resolution}[0m was a collaboration involving North Korean Ambassador Li Hyong Chow and [35m{Ambassador Sung Chul Yang of South Korea}[0m and was co-sponsored by more than 150 other nations . 
(6) Support for [1m[34m{the resolution}[0m was so overwhelming , [1m[34m{it}[0m was adopted by consensus without a vote . 
(7) [35m{Ambassador Sung}[0m told reporters [1m[34m{the resolution}[0m was truly historic because [1m[34m{it}[0m changes [4m[35m{the United Nations}[0m from an arena of confrontation on [33m{Korea}[0m to one of co-operation . 
(8) In a sense , the reintroduction of the Korean issue to [4m[35m{the United Nations}[0m signifies a crucially important turn - around of the history in the relationship between [34m{South Korea and North Korea}[0m . 
(9) In other words , this is a new and fresh start toward genuine peace on [33m{the Korean Peninsula}[0m . 
(10) In a statement on [1m[34m{the resolution}[0m , [4m[36m{the North Korean government}[0m said [32m{the General Assembly 's}[0m action indicates firm support of all member states for peace , security , and reunification of [33m{Korea}[0m . 
(11) On the subject of [1m[33m{reunification}[0m , [35m{South Korean Ambassador Sung}[0m said that while [1m[33m{it}[0m is something to aspire to , [1m[33m{reunification}[0m will probably take years to achieve .
