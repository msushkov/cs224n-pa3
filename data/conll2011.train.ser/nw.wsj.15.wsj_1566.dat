(0) THROUGHOUT [1m[35m{THE 1980s}[0m , investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning . 
(1) Capital has been democratized , and people want in . 
(2) Too often , however , small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists . 
(3) Now [1m[31m{a startling new approach}[0m [3m[33m{is}[0m available to building [4m[34m{your}[0m financial portfolio without undue risk , without extensive planning and without hurting [4m[34m{your}[0m life style one bit ! 
(4) [3m[33m{This}[0m is particularly good news for [31m{those who hate risk , who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way}[0m . 
(5) [31m{You}[0m know who [31m{you}[0m are . 
(6) [4m[32m{My}[0m revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion . 
(7) Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity , [4m[32m{I}[0m do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools , if only to assuage [4m[32m{my}[0m father - in - law , who believes in such things . 
(8) So throughout [1m[35m{the decade}[0m [4m[32m{I}[0m have maintained [4m[32m{my}[0m share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving [4m[32m{my}[0m necessary position in the residential real - estate market . 
(9) [3m[34m{Return on this fine portfolio}[0m has been modest when [3m[34m{it}[0m has not been negative . 
(10) Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses [4m[32m{I}[0m 've invested in during [1m[35m{this prosperous decade}[0m -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20 , 1989 -RRB- . 
(11) Oil - related properties suffered a huge decline until [4m[32m{I}[0m divested [4m[32m{myself}[0m of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery . 
(12) Likewise , [4m[33m{mutual funds}[0m remained relatively flat until [4m[32m{I}[0m made what was , for [4m[32m{me}[0m , a serious investment . 
(13) By 1987 , [4m[33m{these properties}[0m were in [3m[31m{a tailspin}[0m , causing [4m[32m{my}[0m broker at Pru - Bache to remark that [3m[35m{she}[0m 'd `` never seen anything like [3m[31m{it}[0m . '' 
(14) Concerned for [3m[35m{her}[0m state of mind , [4m[32m{I}[0m dropped [4m[33m{them}[0m -- and [4m[36m{the market}[0m instantly began [4m[36m{its}[0m steady climb back to health . 
(15) Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan [1m[32m{New York}[0m real - estate market , which was booming until [4m[32m{I}[0m entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years . 
(16) Disgusted , [4m[32m{I}[0m cast around for a different way to plan [4m[32m{my}[0m asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck [4m[32m{me}[0m : [4m[32m{I}[0m was doing it already ! 
(17) We 've all got [32m{money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it}[0m . 
(18) Bank [32m{it}[0m ? 
(19) Not really ! 
(20) Sock [32m{it}[0m away in long - term instruments ? 
(21) Nonsense ! 
(22) [1m[31m{Daily living}[0m is the best possible investment ! 
(23) Your priorities may be different , but here in Figure 2 is where [4m[32m{I}[0m 've chosen to build for the future : [4m[35m{personal space ; automotive pursuits ; children 's toys ; gardening equipment , bulbs and shrubs ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all}[0m . 
(24) [4m[35m{All}[0m have paid off for [4m[32m{me}[0m in double - digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential . 
(25) At least , according to [4m[32m{my}[0m calculations . 
(26) Personal space -LRB- Figure 3 -RRB- has [1m[36m{grown}[0m 35 % annually over the course of [1m[35m{the decade}[0m , [1m[36m{a performance that would compare positively with an investment in , say , synthetic - leather products for the interiors of cold - weather vehicles , which my cousin got into and sort of regrets}[0m to this day . 
(27) The assortment of expensive children 's toys that [4m[32m{I}[0m have purchased wisely at a host of discount - toy brokerage firms -LRB- Figure 4 -RRB- has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except , perhaps , for [4m[32m{my}[0m record collection , whose worth , [4m[32m{I}[0m think it 's safe to say , is incalculable . 
(28) Continued investment in [4m[32m{my}[0m 1984 subcompact has been part of [4m[32m{my}[0m strategy -LRB- Figure 5 -RRB- , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of [4m[31m{the car 's}[0m original value . 
(29) According to [4m[32m{my}[0m calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of [4m[32m{my}[0m sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- , where [4m[32m{I}[0m plan to offer [4m[31m{it}[0m shortly . 
(30) Expansion of [4m[32m{my}[0m living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to [3m[32m{its}[0m suburban locale . 
(31) [4m[32m{I}[0m have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to [1m[33m{ensure}[0m that [4m[32m{my}[0m grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers . 
(32) [4m[32m{My}[0m initial stake in [1m[33m{this blooming enterprise}[0m has grown tenfold , according to [4m[32m{my}[0m conservative calculations . 
(33) At the same time , [4m[32m{my}[0m share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning . 
(34) Over the course of [1m[35m{the decade}[0m , for instance , [4m[32m{my}[0m return on investment in the area of poker alone -LRB- Figures 7A and 7B -RRB- has been most impressive , showing bodacious annual expansion with -- given the way [4m[32m{my}[0m associates play -- no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond . 
(35) With [1m[31m{this personal strategy firmly in place}[0m , [4m[32m{I}[0m look forward to years of fine life - style investments and increasing widespread leverage . 
(36) [4m[32m{My}[0m kids ' college education looms as [3m[36m{perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending}[0m , although [4m[32m{I}[0m 'll probably have to cash in [1m[34m{their}[0m toy portfolio to take advantage of [3m[36m{it}[0m . 
(37) But with every step [4m[32m{I}[0m take , [4m[32m{I}[0m 'm building wealth . 
(38) You can , too , if you , like [4m[32m{me}[0m , refuse to bite the bullet . 
(39) So go out there and eat that debt . 
(40) You 're right there in the mainstream of American business , building value on the back of insupportable expenditures . 
(41) Henry Kravis , watch out ! 
(42) [4m[32m{Mr. Schwartz}[0m is a business executive and writer in [1m[32m{New York}[0m .
