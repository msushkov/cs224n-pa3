(0) In [1m[31m{Miami}[0m [1m[32m{today}[0m the trial of [36m{five men accused of being spies for Fidel Castro}[0m [34m{got}[0m underway . 
(1) Prosecutors say [36m{the men}[0m ran [35m{a sophisticated eavesdropping operation}[0m . 
(2) [35m{It}[0m served as [1m[36m{the Cuban government 's}[0m eyes and ears in South Florida . 
(3) In Havana [1m[35m{Cuban television}[0m took little note of [34m{this development}[0m . 
(4) [1m[35m{It}[0m was busy celebrating the 7th birthday [1m[32m{today}[0m of [1m[34m{a certain little boy named Elian}[0m . 
(5) Last night Cubans retreated to [3m[32m{never - before seen footage of Elian Gonzalez 's first encounter with President Fidel Castro}[0m . 
(6) [3m[32m{The scene}[0m was filmed five months ago , shortly after [1m[34m{the shipwreck victim}[0m [1m[33m{returned}[0m to [1m[36m{Cuba}[0m following a heated international custody battle . 
(7) [1m[34m{He}[0m 'd spent 7 months in the home of [1m[31m{Miami}[0m relatives who tried to prevent [1m[34m{the boy 's}[0m return , but on that day last summer [1m[34m{Elian}[0m was indeed as far from [1m[31m{Miami}[0m as you can get . 
(8) [3m[32m{The scene}[0m shows [33m{Fidel Castro in his traditional olive green uniform}[0m presenting [1m[34m{the boy}[0m with [3m[33m{a gift , a children 's book written by Cuban independence hero Jose Marti}[0m . 
(9) As [1m[34m{Elian}[0m looks up speechlessly , [33m{Castro}[0m tells [1m[34m{him}[0m to take care of [3m[33m{the book}[0m because [1m[34m{he}[0m will enjoy [3m[33m{it}[0m for the rest of [1m[34m{his}[0m life . 
(10) At one point [33m{Castro}[0m leans over and kisses [1m[34m{the boy}[0m on the hand . 
(11) A year ago [1m[32m{today}[0m , [1m[34m{Elian}[0m was celebrating [1m[34m{his}[0m birthday in the United States being showered with gifts by [1m[34m{his}[0m Florida relatives and very much in the media spotlight . 
(12) By contrast [33m{Castro}[0m has strictly [3m[31m{limited}[0m the media 's access to [1m[34m{the boy}[0m , but [3m[31m{that policy}[0m seems to have changed now with foreign reporters invited to attend [1m[34m{Elian 's}[0m birthday party [1m[32m{today}[0m in [1m[34m{his}[0m hometown of Cardinas , [1m[36m{Cuba}[0m .
