(1) [3m[31m{The office , a Treasury Department unit that is the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ,}[0m said [1m[32m{this}[0m was the first announcement of an enforcement action since [1m[35m{this year 's thrift - bailout legislation}[0m ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public . 
(2) Generally , regulators have n't announced enforcement actions in the past . 
(3) Indeed , [3m[31m{the OTS}[0m said that before [1m[35m{the law}[0m took effect Aug. 9 , [3m[31m{it}[0m banned [1m[33m{another `` key Vision Banc insider ''}[0m from insured financial institutions . 
(4) [1m[33m{That individual}[0m was n't identified . 
(5) [1m[34m{Vision Banc}[0m was placed in government conservatorship in March , and [1m[34m{it}[0m operates under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts . 
(6) [3m[31m{The OTS}[0m did n't say specifically why [1m[32m{the action}[0m was taken against [1m[36m{Ms. Garman}[0m . 
(7) However , [3m[31m{it}[0m said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at [1m[34m{the thrift}[0m , including `` extraordinary loan commissions '' paid to a firm associated with [1m[34m{Vision Banc}[0m officials , and loans diverted through borrowers back to [1m[31m{the thrift officials}[0m . 
(8) [1m[36m{Ms. Garman}[0m could n't be reached for comment .
