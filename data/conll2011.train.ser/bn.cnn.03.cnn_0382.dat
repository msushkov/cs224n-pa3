(0) [4m[35m{That standing ovation that Sammy Sosa got at Wrigley Field last night .}[0m 
(1) A [4m[36m{Major League Baseball}[0m official is scheduled to conduct [34m{interviews in Chicago}[0m . 
(2) [34m{Those interviews}[0m could be a factor as [4m[36m{the league}[0m decides how [4m[35m{Sammy Sosa}[0m will be punished for using [32m{a cork - filled bat}[0m . 
(3) [36m{Our}[0m Gary Tuchman is live . 
(4) Good morning . 
(5) Reporter : 
(6) [4m[35m{The Cub 's player this afternoon}[0m , once again , [4m[35m{Sammy Sosa}[0m will be in the lineup but [4m[35m{he}[0m could find out as early as today what [4m[35m{his}[0m punishment will be and how many games [4m[35m{he}[0m 'll be suspended for . 
(7) [1m[34m{Last night when he went to play for the first time}[0m , [4m[31m{most of the fans on Wrigley Field}[0m gave [4m[35m{him}[0m [4m[35m{a standing ovation}[0m . 
(8) In all fairness , not all of [4m[31m{them}[0m totally believed [4m[35m{Sammy Sosa}[0m but [4m[35m{he}[0m 's a hero here and [4m[31m{they}[0m want to believe [4m[35m{Sammy Sosa}[0m . 
(9) [4m[35m{He}[0m hit the ground ball on the first inning , that scored [4m[36m{a run}[0m , but [4m[36m{the run}[0m was taken away . 
(10) [4m[35m{Sosa}[0m was kicked out of [35m{the game}[0m after [4m[35m{he}[0m was found out [4m[35m{he}[0m had a cork during [32m{the bat}[0m . 
(11) [4m[35m{He}[0m meant not to use [32m{it}[0m during [35m{the game}[0m , but [4m[35m{he}[0m did use [32m{it}[0m during [35m{the game}[0m . 
(12) [4m[36m{Major League Baseball}[0m took [1m[31m{76 of his bats}[0m and [3m[33m{x-rayed}[0m [1m[31m{them}[0m for cork . 
(13) Those x-rays were negative . 
(14) [3m[33m{That}[0m was conducted by a trained radiological technician . 
(15) [4m[34m{We}[0m believe [3m[33m{the x-ray process}[0m was sufficient to determine the state of [1m[31m{those bats}[0m and [4m[34m{we}[0m 're very confident that [1m[31m{all of those bats}[0m were clean and had no foreign substances within [1m[31m{them}[0m . 
(16) It was a mistake . 
(17) We 're all human and we all made a mistake . 
(18) Nobody 's perfect in this world upon . 
(19) Reporter : 
(20) [1m[34m{Last night}[0m with the bat , we assumed was not cork , [4m[35m{Sammy Sosa}[0m struck out the first three times up . 
(21) [4m[35m{He}[0m did hit a single in the ninth inning in a losing effort for [3m[35m{the Chicago Cubs}[0m . 
(22) Back to you . 
(23) There 's a concern with [1m[35m{the huge series there this weekend with the Yankees coming to town}[0m that [4m[35m{Sammy}[0m would be suspended during [1m[35m{that}[0m . 
(24) [3m[31m{The Yankees}[0m vpts been to [1m[32m{Wrigley Field}[0m since [31m{the 1930s}[0m since [3m[31m{they}[0m played [3m[35m{the Cubs}[0m in [31m{the 1930s}[0m . 
(25) [4m[35m{Sosa}[0m could get a suspension , but [4m[35m{he}[0m could appeal suspension . 
(26) So if [4m[35m{he}[0m wanted to play against [3m[31m{the Yankees}[0m , [4m[35m{he}[0m probably will be able to . 
(27) [3m[34m{Gary Tuchman}[0m in [1m[36m{Chicago}[0m . 
(28) Thanks so much . 
(29) Let [36m{'s}[0m bring [3m[36m{Jack}[0m back in with the question of the day and [4m[34m{Bill}[0m 's also joining [36m{us}[0m from D.C. . 
(30) Hello , [4m[34m{William}[0m . 
(31) Over [3m[36m{your}[0m shoulder , [3m[36m{Jack}[0m . 
(32) Keeping an eye on us . 
(33) [1m[33m{Martha Stewart}[0m unfairly singled out for [3m[32m{prosecution}[0m or is [1m[33m{she}[0m getting what [1m[33m{she}[0m deserved ? 
(34) [33m{Jim in New York .}[0m 
(35) [33m{I}[0m 've despised [1m[33m{Martha Stewart}[0m for years before the ImClone scandal , but all this [3m[32m{prosecution}[0m does is how biased [4m[32m{prosecutors}[0m are when [4m[32m{they}[0m deal with moguls who strip the hopes of investors . 
(36) CEOs , sleaze walk free , market should be free to stroll right along with them into the CEO hall of shame . 
(37) Joe in Michigan , prosecute . 
(38) When your skit in life is professing trust and integrity and you violate that responsilibity to your believing public , then you should be done . 
(39) [4m[33m{Jude Nith Florida}[0m , says [4m[33m{I}[0m never liked [1m[33m{Martha}[0m , but now [1m[33m{she}[0m 's a part of good --
