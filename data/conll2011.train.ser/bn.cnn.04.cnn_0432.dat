(23) Who is [1m[33m{Aaron Tonkin}[0m . 
(24) [1m[33m{He}[0m is one of the biggest if not the biggest names in the world of [3m[33m{Hollywood}[0m fund - raisers . 
(25) [1m[33m{A person who would put together celebrities with charities to raise a lot of money .}[0m 
(26) [1m[33m{He}[0m was perhaps best known as kind of the focal point between [3m[31m{Bill}[0m and Hillary Clinton in the [3m[33m{Hollywood}[0m community . 
(27) What 's interesting , [4m[35m{I}[0m mean , reading the article , basically a lot of the celebrities [4m[34m{paid}[0m by [1m[33m{him}[0m to attend charity functions .

(35) Right now , [1m[33m{Aaron Tonkin}[0m factors in [3m[36m{no fewer than seven different federal and state investigations}[0m . 
(36) One of [3m[36m{them}[0m being an [4m[31m{IRS}[0m investigation into several million dollars worth of cash and gift that is [1m[33m{he}[0m gave to many many [3m[33m{Hollywood}[0m celebrities .
