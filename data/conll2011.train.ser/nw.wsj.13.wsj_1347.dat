(0) [36m{Exxon Corp.}[0m [1m[33m{filed}[0m suit against [1m[34m{the state of Alaska}[0m , charging state officials interfered with [36m{the oil company 's}[0m initial efforts to treat [3m[32m{last spring 's giant oil spill}[0m . 
(1) [1m[33m{The action}[0m is a counterclaim to [1m[35m{a suit filed by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies}[0m . 
(2) [1m[34m{The state 's}[0m suit alleges that [36m{Exxon 's}[0m response to [3m[32m{the spill}[0m failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound . 
(3) [1m[35m{That suit}[0m and [36m{Exxon 's}[0m countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage . 
(4) Neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely because damage assessment has n't yet been completed . 
(5) Legal strategists say that damage claims against [36m{the oil giant}[0m and others could well exceed $ 1 billion . 
(6) Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years . 
(7) [36m{Exxon}[0m said in [36m{its}[0m suit that [36m{it}[0m will seek reimbursement from [1m[34m{the state}[0m for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims [36m{it}[0m says resulted from [1m[34m{the state 's}[0m conduct . 
(8) [36m{The oil company}[0m [1m[31m{claims}[0m that Alaskan officials prevented [36m{Exxon}[0m from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of [36m{its}[0m tankers ran into an underwater reef . 
(9) Craig Tillery , an [1m[34m{Alaska}[0m assistant attorney general , said in an interview last night that [36m{Exxon 's}[0m accusations `` are not new . 
(10) [36m{Exxon}[0m has made [1m[31m{them}[0m before , at which point [1m[34m{the state}[0m demonstrated [1m[31m{they}[0m were untrue . 
(11) [1m[34m{The state}[0m will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . '' 
(12) Since [3m[32m{the spill last March}[0m , [36m{Exxon}[0m and [1m[34m{the state}[0m have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after [3m[32m{the spill}[0m , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage . 
(13) [36m{Exxon}[0m claims that use of [3m[31m{dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets ,}[0m was a crucial part of [36m{its}[0m immediate - response plan and that state officials banned [3m[31m{their}[0m use during [1m[36m{the two days of fair weather following the spill}[0m . 
(14) [36m{The oil company}[0m claims that [36m{it}[0m had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the [3m[32m{spill}[0m to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of [1m[32m{the U.S. Coast Guard}[0m . 
(15) [1m[34m{The state 's}[0m opposition to the use of dispersants , [36m{Exxon}[0m says , caused [1m[32m{the Coast Guard}[0m `` to delay granting permission . '' 
(16) Alaskan and [1m[32m{Coast Guard}[0m officials say [36m{Exxon 's}[0m charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during [1m[36m{the first two days following the spill}[0m showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway . 
(17) Use of dispersants was approved when a test on the third day showed some positive results , officials said .
