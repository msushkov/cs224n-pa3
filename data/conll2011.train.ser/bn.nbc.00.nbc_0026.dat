(0) [1m[34m{NBC 's}[0m Claire Shipman now with [1m[35m{the Vice President 's}[0m day back in Washington . 
(1) [3m[31m{Claire ?}[0m 
(2) Sources tell [1m[34m{us}[0m [1m[35m{Al Gore}[0m has not made up [1m[35m{his}[0m mind how far [1m[35m{he}[0m will push the effort in [3m[32m{Florida}[0m . 
(3) [4m[34m{they}[0m say [4m[34m{they}[0m still think [4m[34m{they}[0m could win . 
(4) As for the courts , [1m[34m{we}[0m 're told that decision is not likely to be made until November 17th , when the final tally is in . 
(5) [1m[35m{Al Gore}[0m , in [3m[35m{a deliberate attempt to publicly relax , in the midst of tension of the highest order}[0m . 
(6) [1m[35m{I}[0m think [1m[31m{we}[0m 're going to win [3m[35m{this game}[0m . 
(7) [1m[31m{We}[0m were ahead 6 , so [1m[35m{I}[0m 'm very optimistic . 
(8) [1m[31m{We}[0m 're talking about [3m[35m{the touch football game}[0m . 
(9) Sources say [1m[35m{he}[0m and [1m[35m{his}[0m team are also still optimistic about a win in the recount , because [4m[33m{they}[0m believe a manual count will turn up mistakes in [1m[35m{Gore 's}[0m favor . 
(10) Meanwhile , the [1m[35m{Gore}[0m [3m[32m{Florida}[0m team today asserting there is still a lot of work to be done before naming [3m[36m{the President - elect}[0m . 
(11) I hope [1m[32m{all Americans}[0m agree the will of [1m[32m{the people}[0m , not a computer glitch should select [1m[32m{our}[0m next President . 
(12) I think [1m[36m{we}[0m pledged [1m[36m{ourselves}[0m to try to keep the rhetoric as low as possible , given the situation , and try to carry it out in a professional way . 
(13) Why ? 
(14) As [1m[35m{Gore}[0m considers [1m[35m{his}[0m options with [1m[35m{his}[0m family , advisers say [1m[35m{he}[0m and the campaign realize [4m[33m{they}[0m are operating on two distinct and delicate tracts -- legal , which [4m[33m{they}[0m will pursue to keep options open , and political , which [4m[33m{they}[0m have to watch carefully as [4m[33m{they}[0m feel mounting pressure . 
(15) Friends point out that [1m[35m{the man who was so quick to concede the first time to George W. Bush when he thought he lost and who told aides , `` we have to do this right , ''}[0m is not a politician who would insist on [4m[31m{a long , damaging legal process}[0m , if it is determined [4m[31m{that}[0m 's what going to court would mean . 
(16) Bill Clinton called [1m[35m{Al Gore}[0m today to talk to [1m[35m{him}[0m , less to offer advice than support . 
(17) Finally , friends tell [1m[34m{us}[0m [4m[32m{tonight}[0m that [3m[33m{Gore and his family}[0m are also focused on the -- 
(18) [3m[33m{They}[0m believe depending on what happens , [1m[35m{Gore}[0m [3m[34m{has}[0m a strong platform right now from which to launch a presidential bid in the year 2000 had , and [3m[34m{that}[0m is part of the calculation . 
(19) Tom ? 
(20) Thanks very much , [3m[31m{Claire Shipman}[0m [4m[32m{tonight}[0m .
