(0) Good evening . 
(1) It took the angry voices of [4m[34m{hundreds of thousands of people protesting for days}[0m , but [3m[33m{tonight}[0m [3m[34m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m finally [4m[36m{admitted}[0m [3m[34m{he}[0m [3m[35m{is}[0m no longer the President of [4m[35m{Yugoslavia}[0m , and [3m[34m{he}[0m said [3m[34m{he}[0m had just received [3m[35m{that information}[0m . 
(2) [4m[36m{It}[0m followed a day of intense behind - the - scenes negotiation to decide [3m[34m{his}[0m future and [1m[36m{the future of the country}[0m . 
(3) For now , it seems the new regime of [32m{President Kostunica}[0m is not insisting [3m[34m{Milosevic}[0m leave [4m[35m{the country}[0m . 
(4) [3m[32m{ABC 's Bob Woodruff}[0m is in [3m[36m{Belgrade}[0m [3m[33m{tonight}[0m .

(6) [3m[34m{I , myself ,}[0m am relieved by the enormous responsibility [3m[34m{I}[0m have borne for a whole decade .

(8) On the streets on the second day of the revolution , [4m[31m{the people of Yugoslavia}[0m are savoring [4m[31m{their}[0m victory , swept up by [3m[35m{the sudden death of their dictatorship}[0m . 
(9) [3m[36m{Belgrade}[0m has become one big party . 
(10) While [4m[31m{the people}[0m celebrated , [3m[34m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m reappeared in [3m[36m{Belgrade}[0m in a videotaped meeting . 
(11) [31m{Russia 's}[0m Foreign Minister had come to tell [3m[34m{him}[0m that [31m{the Russians}[0m no longer are behind [3m[34m{him}[0m and [3m[34m{he}[0m should accept [3m[35m{defeat}[0m . 
(12) Sources say [3m[34m{Milosevic}[0m was defiant , promising to stay in [4m[35m{Yugoslavia}[0m and in politics . 
(13) [3m[31m{The people here}[0m say , [3m[31m{their}[0m new President , Vojislav Kostunica , is quickly becoming a populist leader . 
(14) Today [32m{he}[0m , too , met with [31m{Russia 's}[0m Foreign Minister , who carried the Russian President 's endorsement , and [3m[33m{tonight}[0m [32m{he}[0m went on national television to take direct questions from the viewers -- something [3m[34m{Milosevic}[0m never dared to do . 
(15) Disdain for [3m[34m{Milosevic}[0m seems to be growing . 
(16) Yesterday 's uprising was targeted mostly at [3m[34m{him}[0m . 
(17) [4m[34m{The crowds}[0m focused much of [4m[34m{their}[0m anger on anything associated with [3m[34m{Milosevic}[0m . 
(18) This is [4m[32m{the local party headquarters of Milosevic 's wife}[0m . 
(19) As you can see , every window is broken and [4m[32m{the building}[0m is trashed . 
(20) [4m[34m{The mob}[0m also singled out and destroyed the store owned by [3m[34m{Milosevic 's}[0m son . 
(21) [4m[34m{They}[0m burned [1m[35m{the TV station that carried Milosevic 's words}[0m and beat [1m[35m{the station 's}[0m director , but [3m[33m{tonight}[0m , [4m[34m{the people}[0m seem to be turning away from anger , praying instead for a better future . 
(22) A future and [4m[35m{a country}[0m without [3m[34m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m . 
(23) [3m[32m{Bob Woodruff}[0m , [3m[36m{Belgrade}[0m .
