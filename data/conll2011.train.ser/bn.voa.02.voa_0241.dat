(6) [3m[33m{Edwin Boje}[0m made timers for bombs that were sold to [3m[36m{Libya}[0m and allegedly used to [36m{blow}[0m up [4m[33m{the plane}[0m . 
(7) [31m{Mr. Taler}[0m called [3m[33m{him}[0m a greedy fantasist who wanted to implicate [3m[36m{Libya}[0m in order to get a huge financial reward from the FBI . 
(8) [31m{Mr. Taler}[0m says [3m[33m{Edwin Boje}[0m also lied about [3m[33m{his}[0m dealings with [4m[35m{the East German Stazi who he also sold timers to}[0m . 
(9) [3m[33m{Mr. Boje}[0m testified that [3m[34m{the timers}[0m were different but [31m{Mr. Taler}[0m claims [3m[34m{they}[0m were exactly the same ones as the Libyans had .

(12) [4m[34m{The other witness Mr. Taler tore into}[0m was a Libyan double agent known as Jiaka .
