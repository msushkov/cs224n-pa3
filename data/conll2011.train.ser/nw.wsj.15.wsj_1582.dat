(0) If you think you have stress - related problems on the job , there 's good news and bad news . 
(1) You 're probably right , and you are n't alone . 
(2) [3m[31m{A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health}[0m , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from [36m{anxiety disorders or a stress - related illness}[0m , with about 13 % suffering from depression . 
(3) [3m[31m{The study}[0m surveyed [1m[32m{a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors}[0m about [1m[32m{their}[0m perceptions of [36m{these problems in their companies}[0m . 
(4) [3m[31m{It}[0m is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by [3m[36m{the New York Business Group , a non-profit organization with about 300 members}[0m . 
(5) [3m[31m{The stress study}[0m was undertaken because [3m[34m{problems related to stress}[0m `` are much more prevalent than [3m[34m{they}[0m seem , '' said [1m[31m{Leon J. Warshaw , executive director of the business group}[0m . 
(6) In presenting [3m[31m{the study}[0m late last week , [1m[31m{Dr. Warshaw}[0m estimated the cost of [3m[33m{these types of disorders}[0m to business is substantial . 
(7) Occupational disability related to [36m{anxiety , depression and stress}[0m costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation . 
(8) In terms of days lost on the job , [3m[31m{the study}[0m estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of [36m{stress , anxiety or depression}[0m . 
(9) [1m[31m{He}[0m added that the cost for stress - related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims . 
(10) `` [3m[36m{We}[0m hope to sensitize [1m[35m{employers}[0m '' to recognize [36m{the problems}[0m so [1m[35m{they}[0m can do something about [36m{them}[0m , [1m[31m{Dr. Warshaw}[0m said . 
(11) Early intervention into [3m[33m{these types of problems}[0m can apparently save businesses long - term expense associated with hospitalization , which sometimes results when [36m{these problems}[0m go untreated for too long . 
(12) Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress - related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance . 
(13) But although 56 % of the respondents in [3m[31m{the study}[0m indicated that [1m[36m{mental - health problems}[0m were fairly pervasive in the workplace , there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help . 
(14) [1m[36m{The disorders , which 20 years ago struck middle - age and older people ,}[0m `` now strike people at the height of productivity , '' says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld , of the National Institute of Mental Health , who spoke at the presentation of [3m[31m{the study 's}[0m findings . 
(15) [3m[31m{The poll}[0m showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem , with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress - related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing . 
(16) [3m[31m{The poll}[0m also noted fear of a takeover as a stress - producing event in larger companies . 
(17) [35m{More than eight in 10 respondents}[0m reported such a stress - provoking situation in [35m{their}[0m company . 
(18) Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings . 
(19) [3m[31m{The study , which received funding from Upjohn Co. , which makes several drugs to treat stress - related illnesses ,}[0m also found 47 % of [3m[32m{the managers}[0m said stress , anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production . 
(20) Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress - related problems was cited by 30 % of those [1m[32m{polled}[0m . 
(21) Although [1m[31m{Dr. Warshaw}[0m points out that [3m[35m{stress and anxiety}[0m have [3m[35m{their}[0m positive uses , `` stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout . '' 
(22) [1m[31m{He}[0m also noted that [1m[33m{various work environments , such as night work ,}[0m have [1m[33m{their}[0m own `` stressors . '' 
(23) `` We all like stress , but there 's a limit , '' says [1m[34m{Paul D'Arcy , of Rohrer , Hibler & Replogle , a corporate psychology and management consulting firm}[0m . 
(24) The problem , says [1m[34m{Mr. D'Arcy , a psychologist ,}[0m is that `` it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance .
