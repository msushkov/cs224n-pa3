(0) It 's time now to look at [35m{professional soccer and rugby}[0m and how [35m{it}[0m can [1m[34m{be}[0m bad for a player 's health . 
(1) [1m[34m{This}[0m is according to two British medical studies . 
(2) As [32m{we}[0m hear now from [32m{VOA 's}[0m David McClary , lifetime injuries are common and in the case of [1m[31m{rugby}[0m , increasing . 
(3) A study of [36m{nearly 300 former British professional soccer players}[0m finds that nearly half have suffered [31m{the chronic joint disease " osteoarthritis "}[0m often as early as age 40 . 
(4) Most have [31m{the disease in two or more joints}[0m . 
(5) Nearly one third of [36m{those surveyed}[0m had surgery at least once since retiring , mostly on knees with knee replacement a common option . 
(6) The Coventry University researchers who report the findings in [33m{the British Journal of Sports Medicine}[0m say anxiety and depression are common among those so injured , possibly as a result of pain and impaired mobility . 
(7) A second study in [33m{the same journal}[0m finds that injuries among [1m[31m{Rugby Union}[0m players have nearly doubled since [1m[31m{the sport}[0m became professional five years ago , from 27 % to 47 % . 
(8) [1m[32m{The Scottish researchers}[0m say one possible explanation is [34m{the use of padded equipment}[0m . 
(9) [1m[32m{They}[0m suggest [34m{it}[0m gives a false sense of security causing more aggressive play .
