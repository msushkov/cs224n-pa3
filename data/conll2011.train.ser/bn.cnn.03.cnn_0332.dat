(0) [1m[34m{We}[0m have an update now on [1m[36m{a dramatic story that people everywhere around the world are talking about}[0m . 
(1) Last week [1m[34m{we}[0m told you about [1m[33m{Aaron Ralston , the 27 - year - old outdoorsman who amputated his own arm with a pocket knife after spending five days pinned by a boulder}[0m . 
(2) For the first time [1m[34m{we}[0m 're hearing from [1m[33m{his}[0m parents and [3m[31m{they}[0m 're sharing some thoughts about what [1m[33m{he}[0m told [3m[31m{them}[0m about [1m[35m{this amazing ordeal}[0m . 
(3) [3m[33m{Arthel Neville}[0m is joining [1m[34m{us}[0m from [36m{the CNN newsroom in Atlanta}[0m with details . 
(4) First of all , if [3m[33m{I}[0m could update you on [1m[33m{Aaron 's}[0m progress . 
(5) Over the weekend [1m[33m{he}[0m was upgraded to fair condition and [1m[33m{he}[0m was scheduled to have surgery today to prepare what remains of [1m[33m{his}[0m arm for a prosthetic . 
(6) [1m[33m{His}[0m ordeal started a week ago Saturday when [1m[33m{he}[0m was climbing in remote canyons in Utah alone . 
(7) When [1m[33m{he}[0m put [1m[33m{his}[0m arm into a crack in the canyon wall , [3m[32m{an 800 pound boulder}[0m shifted , pinning [1m[33m{him}[0m right there . 
(8) Now three days later [1m[33m{his}[0m water ran out and on the fifth day [1m[33m{he}[0m made the unimaginable decision to amputate [1m[33m{his}[0m arm below the elbow with [3m[34m{a pocket knife}[0m . 
(9) [1m[33m{He}[0m applied a turn to keep from bleeding to death . 
(10) [1m[33m{He}[0m climbed back down to the canyon floor and hiked five miles before [1m[33m{he}[0m was found . 
(11) Then [1m[33m{Aaron}[0m was airlifted to a hospital where [1m[33m{he}[0m was able to walk in on [1m[33m{his}[0m own . 
(12) Now less than an hour ago , [1m[33m{his}[0m parents spoke with reporters in Grand Junction , [32m{Colorado}[0m , where [1m[33m{he}[0m is being treated . 
(13) [1m[33m{Aaron}[0m mentioned that as [1m[33m{he}[0m got near the destination the night before [1m[33m{his}[0m trek , that [1m[33m{he}[0m realized [1m[33m{he}[0m had n't left word and [1m[33m{he}[0m actually thought about making that call and thought it was too late . 
(14) Immediately when [1m[33m{his}[0m boss called to say [1m[33m{he}[0m had not reported for work , immediately [1m[32m{I}[0m knew something really , really bad was wrong . 
(15) It was n't until just a few minutes after 3:00 on Thursday afternoon when the call came back again that they had found [1m[33m{him}[0m and [1m[33m{he}[0m was alive and all [1m[32m{I}[0m could say was Thank God , and from there you all know pretty much what happened . 
(16) By the way [1m[35m{this}[0m was n't [1m[33m{Aron 's}[0m first brush with death . 
(17) This year [1m[33m{he}[0m and two friends survived an avalanche in [32m{Colorado}[0m , but if you think [1m[33m{he}[0m 's done , well [1m[33m{he}[0m 's not . 
(18) [1m[33m{He}[0m 's trying to become first person to [34m{climb}[0m all the [32m{Colorado}[0m mountains higher than 14,000 feet , and , Wolf , [1m[33m{he}[0m wants to do [34m{this}[0m alone . 
(19) [3m[33m{Arthel Neville}[0m [1m[36m{this}[0m is an amazing story . 
(20) Thank [3m[33m{you}[0m for sharing with [1m[34m{us}[0m and [1m[34m{our}[0m viewers all the latest developments .
