(9) And just to be clear , -- what kind of facility was [1m[36m{it}[0m that you arrested [4m[31m{him}[0m at ? 
(10) [4m[31m{He}[0m was in the rear of [1m[36m{a tire shop}[0m . 
(11) It 's sort of like a mall area , but [4m[31m{he}[0m was hanging around [1m[36m{a tire shop , an automotive tire shop}[0m , and [3m[32m{someone}[0m noticed [4m[31m{him}[0m , recognized [4m[31m{him}[0m , made [4m[32m{a call to the fugitive unit}[0m .
