(0) [35m{Turner Broadcasting System Inc.}[0m said [35m{it}[0m [36m{formed}[0m [1m[34m{a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to U.S. theaters , too}[0m . 
(1) [35m{The operator of cable - television networks}[0m said [1m[34m{the new Turner Pictures unit}[0m will produce movies that will premiere on [35m{Turner Broadcasting 's}[0m Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters . 
(2) [1m[34m{The unit 's}[0m first two offerings are slated to be [1m[31m{`` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels}[0m , and [34m{`` Treasure Island , '' produced by Charlton Heston , who also stars in the movie}[0m . 
(3) Ted Turner , [35m{Turner Broadcasting 's}[0m chairman , was named chairman of [1m[34m{Turner Pictures}[0m , and [32m{Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks ,}[0m was named president of [1m[34m{the unit}[0m . 
(4) In an interview , [32m{Mr. Hogan}[0m said [1m[34m{the subsidiary 's}[0m primary mission will be to make [33m{movies}[0m for [1m[35m{TNT}[0m and to [1m[36m{distribute}[0m [33m{them}[0m internationally . 
(5) But [32m{he}[0m said [35m{Turner Broadcasting}[0m already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in [1m[33m{the U.S.}[0m . 
(6) `` When [1m[36m{that}[0m occurs , and when the time is right , [1m[34m{we}[0m 'll release [33m{the films}[0m in [1m[33m{the U.S.}[0m , '' [32m{he}[0m said , adding that [1m[34m{Turner Pictures}[0m may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991 . 
(7) [35m{Turner}[0m has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for [35m{its}[0m networks in recent years , but [35m{the company}[0m has never acted as a full - fledged movie studio and released [35m{its}[0m own pictures to theaters . 
(8) [32m{Mr. Hogan}[0m said [1m[32m{`` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming '' and `` Treasure Island ''}[0m cost more than $ 6 million each to make , which is only about one - third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release . 
(9) [36m{The Turner move}[0m is in line with a cable - TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films . 
(10) In July , Viacom Inc. formed Viacom Pictures to produce 12 low - budget movies a year that will premiere on Showtime network and be distributed later in various markets , including foreign theaters .
