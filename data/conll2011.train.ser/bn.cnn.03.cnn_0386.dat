(0) Martha Stewart is n't the only corporate figurehead in the news today . 
(1) [1m[34m{The jury}[0m has handed down a $ 30 million , [1m[34m{a Grand Rapids jury}[0m saying [34m{Taco Bell}[0m has to pay [3m[33m{the true creators of the Chihuahua mascot two men claimed their idea originated}[0m , and proved [3m[35m{I}[0m am in the wrong business . 
(2) [34m{Taco Bell}[0m is appealing . 
(3) Joining [3m[35m{me}[0m is [1m[31m{Tom Rinks with his attorney John Doza}[0m . 
(4) [1m[31m{Tom}[0m , [1m[31m{you}[0m 've got to be happy with the settlement . 
(5) [3m[35m{I}[0m know [34m{they}[0m 're going to appeal , but first tell [3m[35m{me}[0m how [1m[31m{you}[0m came up with [1m[32m{the Chihuahua character}[0m ? 
(6) [36m{Joe}[0m and [1m[31m{myself}[0m , [36m{he}[0m 's the partner , [3m[33m{we}[0m were looking to design some licenses to put on some t - shirts , and at the time big dogs were big , and all the mean dogs , and no fear was a big hit , and [3m[33m{we}[0m thought it was time for a bit of a change for the 18 crowd . 
(7) So [3m[33m{we}[0m actually took the opposite of all that , and looked for [3m[32m{the smallest , weakest , most timid animal}[0m , and tried to make [3m[32m{him}[0m cool , tried to make [3m[32m{him}[0m big , and [3m[33m{we}[0m knew if he gave [3m[32m{him}[0m some spunk , everybody would root for [3m[32m{him}[0m . 
(8) How did [1m[35m{the Taco Bell folks}[0m run into [3m[33m{you}[0m ? 
(9) [1m[35m{They}[0m actually came to [3m[33m{us}[0m at [3m[34m{a licensing show}[0m . 
(10) [3m[33m{We}[0m had been licensing to a bunch of different manufacturers , and in 1996 [3m[33m{we}[0m were at [3m[34m{a show in New York City where Nick Loada and Universal Studios , and Taco Bell walked up to us and said they were looking for a masscot for their brand and this would be perfect}[0m . 
(11) That started [1m[36m{a year relationship we had with them}[0m . 
(12) And [1m[36m{it}[0m went on for a year , and [3m[33m{you}[0m thought [35m{it}[0m did n't pan out and then [3m[33m{you}[0m pick up a trade paper and read [34m{they}[0m 're going ahead with [35m{it}[0m ? 
(13) After [3m[33m{we}[0m 'd finalized all the commercials , and actually done the campaign for [34m{them}[0m , [34m{they}[0m hired a new ad agency , and telephone calls just started staggering off . 
(14) Then [34m{they}[0m stopped coming , and [3m[33m{we}[0m heard about [1m[33m{the ads}[0m , and [1m[33m{they}[0m were exactly what [3m[33m{we}[0m had presented for over a year . 
(15) When [1m[31m{you}[0m first heard [3m[31m{that}[0m , or read [3m[31m{that}[0m , did [1m[31m{you}[0m just go ballistic ? 
(16) [3m[35m{I}[0m mean , no offense , but it was [1m[31m{you}[0m and [36m{one other guy}[0m who created [1m[32m{this thing}[0m . 
(17) [34m{They}[0m 're a huge , huge corporation . 
(18) Yeah , it was devastating , to say the least , but [3m[33m{we}[0m really did n't know --
