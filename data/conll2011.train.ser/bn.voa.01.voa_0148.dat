(0) Thank [1m[31m{you}[0m very much [1m[31m{Bob}[0m . 
(1) There could be [34m{verdicts today in three different court cases relating to the State 's contested presidential election in Florida}[0m and [34m{the verdicts}[0m are believed to comprise [1m[36m{Vice President Al Gore 's}[0m last chance to win [4m[35m{the White House}[0m by reversing [4m[36m{George W Bush 's}[0m election day victory . 
(2) [1m[32m{Corespondent Nick Semion}[0m reports from [1m[35m{Tallahassee where the most closely watched ruling could come from Florida 's Supreme Court}[0m . 
(3) [36m{Florida 's}[0m highest court must decide whether to [33m{overturn}[0m a strongly ordered lower court decision that firmly rejected [1m[36m{Vice President Gore 's}[0m request for a hand recount of thousands of . 
(4) [1m[33m{The Bush campaign}[0m says [33m{this}[0m would amount to rewriting [36m{Florida}[0m election law and that no evidence exists that any voter was denied the right to cast the ballot . 
(5) In two separate cases , lower courts are considering [31m{a demand by pro-Gore voters that thousands of absentee ballots be thrown out because Republican party workers were allowed to adjust ballot applications}[0m . 
(6) [1m[33m{Bush campaign}[0m attorney Matthew Staber says the solution should not be to penalize the wrong people . 
(7) When we look at [31m{the remedy that they are requesting}[0m , even the disenfranchisement of one voice in this case is a price too high to pay . 
(8) While all this is going on , the Republican leaders of [36m{Florida 's}[0m legislature [1m[34m{begin}[0m a special session Friday , to appoint [36m{the state 's}[0m 25 electors , [1m[34m{a move designed to ensure that George W Bush is guaranteed enough electoral votes to win the White House}[0m .
