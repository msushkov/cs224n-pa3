(0) Meanwhile , the director of the FBI , Louis Freeh , is headed for [33m{Yemen}[0m to personally supervise the investigation into the attack on [4m[36m{the `` USS Cole}[0m , '' and some progress is being made . 
(1) [1m[34m{NBC 's}[0m Jim Miklaszewski is at [34m{the Pentagon}[0m [1m[33m{tonight}[0m , with the latest for [1m[34m{us}[0m now . 
(2) [31m{Tom}[0m , [1m[32m{investigators}[0m [1m[33m{tonight}[0m are still trying to figure out exactly what kind of explosive could cause such devastating damage to [4m[36m{the `` Cole}[0m . '' 
(3) [1m[32m{They}[0m 're focusing on an abandoned apartment where bomb - making materials were found , but today , [35m{the Yemen President}[0m [36m{claims}[0m that the explosive found could only come from the U.S. or Israel , implying that the materials or [1m[35m{the weapon itself}[0m were Western - made . 
(4) U.S. military and intelligence officials can not confirm [35m{his}[0m claim . 
(5) Authorities also discovered [1m[31m{two Yemen passports}[0m , but quickly determined [1m[31m{they}[0m were fakes , not surprising to one U.S. official , who said everything in [33m{Yemen 's}[0m terrorist underground is a forgery .
