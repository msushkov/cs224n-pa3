(0) The Los Angles Times had [3m[34m{an editorial on Thursday that included a uh shocking line}[0m /. 
(1) [1m[36m{I}[0m just want to find out if [3m[32m{it}[0m 's true /. 
(2) [3m[34m{It}[0m said this /. 
(3) [3m[35m{The aged shuttle Discovery}[0m is twenty - one years old /. /. 
(4) are already at more than twice their intended design life /. 
(5) [3m[33m{Engineers}[0m are sometimes [31m{reduced}[0m to hunting for obsolete hardware and electronics on [36m{Ebay}[0m /. 
(6) Is [31m{that}[0m true /? 
(7) Well [3m[35m{the shuttle}[0m was designed for a hundred flights in ten years /. 
(8) And uh [3m[35m{the Discovery}[0m for example almost twenty years old has flown thirty times /. 
(9) So in terms of length of time [33m{they}[0m are older than [33m{they}[0m were designed for /. 
(10) But [1m[35m{we}[0m have in fact upgraded areas /. 
(11) [1m[35m{We}[0m have ongoing programs to evaluate the effects of pure age on [4m[36m{hardware}[0m /. 
(12) [4m[36m{This hardware}[0m is very well maintained /. 
(13) [1m[35m{We}[0m have uh environmentally controlled areas where [1m[35m{we}[0m do all [1m[35m{our}[0m work /. 
(14) so [1m[35m{we}[0m believe [1m[35m{we}[0m understand the effect of aging on [1m[35m{our}[0m equipment /. 
(15) [3m[31m{some of the ground test equipment that was designed in the late seventies or early eighties}[0m [3m[31m{that}[0m has not been updated /. 
(16) Occasionally [3m[33m{they}[0m have had to go to some unusual places to find [34m{replacement parts}[0m /. 
(17) but [3m[31m{that}[0m 's the ground equipment uh that we 're referring to not the flight equipment /. 
(18) Including [36m{eBay}[0m /? 
(19) uh [35m{I}[0m 'm not sure exactly where [3m[33m{they}[0m 've gone /. 
(20) but [3m[33m{they}[0m have told [35m{me}[0m [3m[33m{they}[0m 've had to be very ingenious sometimes to find some of [34m{these older electronic parts}[0m /. 
(21) [1m[31m{We}[0m 're almost completely out of time /. 
(22) but a quick question /. 
(23) When do [35m{you}[0m believe if [1m[33m{it}[0m happens the next shuttle will [1m[33m{take}[0m off /? 
(24) Well [1m[35m{we}[0m are putting together a team that will go off and do an investigation uh and come up with the solution on [1m[32m{this problem}[0m /. 
(25) and [35m{I}[0m am very hopeful that the delay will be short /. 
(26) Uh it 's [1m[35m{our}[0m intention to get to the bottom of [1m[32m{this}[0m and fix [1m[32m{it}[0m in a very rapid manner /. 
(27) [1m[35m{We}[0m have windows in September November December and uh then in February /. 
(28) And uh [35m{I}[0m believe [1m[35m{we}[0m 'll be flying in one of the near term windows /. 
(29) But the point of the matter is [1m[35m{we}[0m must understand what [1m[32m{this problem}[0m was caused by [1m[32m{this pal ramp foam loss problem}[0m and provide a solution to [1m[32m{it}[0m because it 's unacceptable to fly until [1m[35m{we}[0m fix [1m[32m{it}[0m /. 
(30) Well good luck uh to [1m[35m{all of NASA}[0m especially those astronauts on board [3m[35m{the Discovery}[0m /. 
(31) and [1m[31m{we}[0m 'll be praying and hoping for the best /. 
(32) Thanks very much [35m{Mr. Hale}[0m for joining [1m[31m{us}[0m /. 
(33) Thank [1m[36m{you}[0m very much [1m[36m{Wolf}[0m /. 
(34) And do n't forget [1m[31m{our}[0m Web question of the week should religion play a role in Iraq 's new constitution /. 
(35) you can cast your vote /. 
(36) Go to CNN dot com slash late edition /. 
(37) [1m[31m{we}[0m 'll have the results in the next hour /. 
(38) [1m[31m{We}[0m 'll be right back /. 
(39) There 's much more ahead on [32m{Late Edition}[0m including [1m[34m{Egypt 's}[0m prime minister Akmed Alze the pressure for political reform inside [3m[36m{his}[0m own country and much more /. 
(40) Then a successful reign in terror in Great Britian /. 
(41) [1m[31m{We}[0m 'll assess the lingering threat uh in United States and around the world from three security experts /. 
(42) [32m{Late Edition}[0m continues right at the top of the hour /.
