(0) Elsewhere in the Middle East , officials from the FBI and the CIA and marine anti-terrorist specialists have arrived in [1m[35m{Yemen}[0m to investigate yesterday 's explosion that crippled the [36m{US Navy}[0m destroyer , Cole . 
(1) Seven sailors are confirmed dead and ten of the missing are now presumed dead . 
(2) The wounded have been evacuated to Germany and to [32m{neighboring Djibouti}[0m . 
(3) [32m{Djibouti}[0m is where until last year [36m{the Navy}[0m conducted [36m{its}[0m Red Sea refueling operations . 
(4) [1m[31m{John Moore , a former government intelligence analyst}[0m says it was a mistake for [1m[34m{those operations}[0m to [3m[35m{move}[0m to [4m[32m{Aden}[0m . 
(5) [1m[31m{I}[0m tend to fault [3m[35m{the US policy that brought the refueling activity from Djibouti to Aden}[0m , given the abundance of threat indicators in [1m[35m{the country , that being Yemen}[0m . 
(6) It has been known for some time that various groups , either Palestinians , North African groups , some of Bin Laden 's men actively reside in [1m[35m{Yemen}[0m , so again , [1m[31m{I}[0m really question the wisdom of [3m[35m{that policy}[0m . 
(7) [1m[31m{You}[0m say that [3m[36m{the US}[0m was using [32m{Djibouti}[0m for more or less the same purposes that , for the last year or so , [3m[36m{they}[0m have been using [1m[35m{Yemen}[0m , that [3m[36m{they}[0m knew that there was a much more anti-American atmosphere in [1m[35m{Yemen}[0m . 
(8) Why then did [3m[36m{they}[0m go there ? 
(9) Did [3m[36m{they}[0m have some other overriding concerns ? 
(10) [3m[36m{The US}[0m has been [4m[36m{attempting}[0m to support movements for democratization in [1m[35m{Yemen}[0m and there has been some attempts to buttress [1m[35m{the government of Ali Abdullah Saleh}[0m and [1m[31m{I}[0m believe that [3m[35m{this}[0m is directly tied into [4m[36m{that}[0m . 
(11) There were [4m[33m{elections held , I believe , a year or so ago}[0m . 
(12) [3m[36m{The Americans}[0m were [31m{involved}[0m as far as assessing and evaluating the validity of [4m[33m{the elections}[0m , and [1m[31m{I}[0m think [31m{this}[0m grew out of [4m[36m{that policy of supporting the Yemeni government}[0m , but again the problem that [1m[35m{the Yemeni government}[0m faces is [1m[35m{they}[0m do n't actively control [3m[32m{the countryside}[0m . 
(13) [3m[32m{That}[0m is split between various tribal groups and there is also , as [1m[31m{I}[0m mentioned , [4m[34m{extremists that look at Yemen as , say , heaven}[0m . 
(14) [4m[34m{They}[0m have been there for well on 20 years , various groups at different times , of course . 
(15) In terms of talking about [1m[35m{Yemen}[0m and giving [1m[32m{us}[0m a feeling for what is interesting about [1m[35m{this country}[0m , another thing that is interesting about [1m[35m{it}[0m would seem to be that [1m[35m{this}[0m [4m[35m{is}[0m a country that had pretty much sided , as I understand it , with Iraq during [35m{the Gulf War}[0m . 
(16) Is [4m[35m{that}[0m true and if so why is [3m[36m{the United States}[0m involved with [1m[35m{it}[0m now ? 
(17) [4m[35m{That}[0m is true . 
(18) [1m[35m{The government of Yemen}[0m , led by [1m[33m{the current President Ali Abdullah Saleh}[0m , did exhibit pro-Iraqi sentiment during [35m{the Gulf War}[0m . 
(19) As far as the reasoning behind why [3m[36m{the US}[0m is trying to rebuild [3m[36m{its}[0m ties with [1m[35m{Yemen}[0m , again [3m[34m{the US policy}[0m is to try to build a bridge with [1m[36m{as many countries as possible within a region , particularly the Islamic world}[0m . 
(20) [4m[31m{We}[0m hope [1m[36m{the countries}[0m can become potential friends , if not allies , in the region . 
(21) So there is a bit of , ok , yes [4m[31m{we}[0m do n't agree with what you did in the past , but let [4m[31m{'s}[0m try to put that behind [4m[31m{us}[0m and look forward . 
(22) And what have the developments there led [1m[31m{you}[0m to believe about the wisdom of [3m[34m{that policy}[0m ? 
(23) The wisdom of [3m[31m{trying}[0m to establish ties with [1m[35m{the Yemeni government}[0m , [1m[31m{I}[0m can certainly see the logic behind [3m[31m{that}[0m . 
(24) Again [1m[31m{my}[0m specific question comes in to why [3m[36m{they}[0m moved [1m[34m{the refueling activity}[0m from [32m{Djibouti}[0m to [4m[32m{Aden}[0m , given the level of threat in [1m[35m{the country}[0m . 
(25) It is one thing to build relationships , it is another thing to put actually [3m[33m{your men and women}[0m on the front line , when [3m[33m{they}[0m did n't have to be there . 
(26) [1m[31m{John Moore}[0m is a research analyst at the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis . 
(27) [1m[31m{He}[0m joined [1m[32m{us}[0m in [1m[32m{our}[0m studios here in Boston . 
(28) Thank [1m[31m{you}[0m very much . 
(29) Thank [1m[32m{you}[0m .
