(0) [3m[32m{We}[0m are back . 
(1) It 's been a few days since [3m[32m{we}[0m had any new developments in [1m[32m{the Laci Peterson case}[0m . 
(2) It appears [3m[32m{we}[0m do have [3m[35m{something to talk about this morning , perhaps a search for some new evidence under way}[0m . 
(3) Let [3m[32m{'s}[0m check in with [3m[32m{our}[0m Rusty Dornin , out in Modesto , California , with the latest on [3m[35m{that}[0m . 
(4) Reporter : 
(5) We knew it was a matter of time before police [35m{got}[0m back into the water in [1m[33m{San Francisco Bay}[0m looking for more evidence in [1m[32m{the Laci Peterson case}[0m . 
(6) [35m{That}[0m happened [3m[34m{this morning}[0m . 
(7) [3m[33m{Numerous R agencies ' boats with sonar technology and divers}[0m into [1m[33m{San Francisco Bay}[0m . 
(8) [3m[33m{They}[0m came from the Richmond marina as well as the Urbuinano Island , the Coast Guard station . 
(9) It 's being used as a staging area . 
(10) [3m[33m{They}[0m are going to be launching a search for what may be left in [1m[33m{the bay here}[0m now . 
(11) As you know about a month ago [4m[32m{Laci Peterson 's}[0m body washed up right here , an area called Point Isabelle . 
(12) Right across the channel here is [1m[31m{an area known as Brooks Island}[0m . 
(13) [3m[31m{police}[0m say [1m[31m{that}[0m is where [1m[36m{Scott Peterson}[0m told [3m[31m{them}[0m that [1m[36m{he}[0m did go fishing the day that [4m[32m{Laci Peterson}[0m did disappear . 
(14) Now , a source close to the investigation has told [1m[35m{me}[0m that what [1m[34m{they}[0m are really looking for are [4m[31m{concrete anchors or weights which may have parts of Laci Peterson 's body or clothing or something attached to it}[0m , that [1m[34m{they}[0m did discover [36m{a concrete weight}[0m in [1m[36m{Scott Peterson 's}[0m warehouse . 
(15) If [36m{it}[0m matched , [36m{that}[0m would be something that could link [1m[36m{Scott Peterson}[0m -- [36m{it}[0m would be like a smoking gun in [1m[32m{this case}[0m . 
(16) Inevitably [1m[34m{they}[0m are looking for something linked to [4m[32m{Laci Peterson}[0m , whether --
