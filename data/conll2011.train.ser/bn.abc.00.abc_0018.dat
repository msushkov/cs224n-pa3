(0) [32m{The attack on the `` USS Cole '' in Yemen}[0m is being reassessed tonight . 
(1) [31m{ABC 's}[0m Barry Serafin is in our Washington Bureau . 
(2) [33m{I}[0m gather the thing that [4m[35m{the Navy}[0m is looking at is the actual timing . 
(3) We were led to believe that [32m{the attack}[0m occurred just as [4m[36m{the `` USS Cole ''}[0m was tying up . 
(4) Not true , apparently ? 
(5) Not true , according to new information now released by [4m[35m{the Navy}[0m , [33m{Peter}[0m . 
(6) [4m[35m{The Navy}[0m now says [4m[36m{the ship}[0m was actually moored nearly two hours before [32m{the explosion}[0m took place . 
(7) [4m[36m{It}[0m was , in fact , in the process of being refueled at the time of [32m{the blast}[0m . 
(8) the theory was that RTJ C World News / [33m{Peter Jennings}[0m [31m{ABC}[0m % RTJ ! had [4m[33m{slipped}[0m in as part of [35m{the mooring operation}[0m . 
(9) [4m[33m{That}[0m was not true . 
(10) [4m[36m{The ship}[0m was tied up . 
(11) [4m[36m{It}[0m was in a very vulnerable position as [4m[36m{it}[0m was being refueled . 
(12) However , [4m[35m{the Navy}[0m now says that [34m{hands on deck who were manning machine guns , as part of an alert}[0m , still believed [34m{they}[0m had seen [36m{this small boat}[0m as part of [35m{the mooring operation}[0m , and that is apparently why [34m{they}[0m were not suspicious . 
(13) Let [33m{me}[0m understand the last point again . 
(14) If [36m{it}[0m was not part of [35m{the mooring operation}[0m , does it mean [36m{it}[0m was lost in a cluster of boats or operating clear to sea ? 
(15) [36m{This}[0m was a small boat that at that point , [33m{Peter}[0m , should not have been approaching [4m[36m{this ship}[0m , but apparently [34m{the hands on deck who were supposed to be maintaining security}[0m , believed [36m{this}[0m was a small boat [34m{they}[0m had seen earlier as part of [35m{the mooring operation}[0m , and therefore did not view [36m{it}[0m as a suspicious boat . 
(16) Thanks very much . 
(17) It often happens in a case like this , as time goes on , the assessment changes . 
(18) Today , the bodies of the last four sailors recovered from [4m[36m{the `` Cole ''}[0m were sent home to the United States . 
(19) 17 sailors were killed in [32m{the blast}[0m . 
(20) At Arlington National Cemetery , the first of the funerals . 
(21) [4m[32m{Cheron Gunn from Rex , Georgia}[0m was buried next to [4m[32m{his}[0m ship mate Richard Costello of Morrisville , Pennsylvania .
