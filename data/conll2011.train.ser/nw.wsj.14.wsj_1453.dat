(0) Diversification [4m[33m{pays}[0m . 
(1) [4m[33m{That}[0m 's a fundamental lesson for investors , but [4m[33m{its}[0m truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after [1m[33m{the stock market 's}[0m [36m{Friday - the - 13th}[0m plunge . 
(2) Stock funds , like [1m[33m{the market as a whole}[0m , generally [3m[36m{dropped}[0m more than 2 % in [32m{the week through last Thursday}[0m , according to [4m[32m{figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc}[0m . 
(3) [3m[36m{That}[0m reflects [4m[33m{the huge drop a week ago Friday}[0m , [4m[34m{last Monday 's}[0m rebound and the dips and blips that followed . 
(4) But several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of [1m[33m{the market 's}[0m slide . 
(5) Funds that invest internationally were the top - performing stock and fixed - income funds . 
(6) `` More than ever , [1m[32m{people}[0m should realize [1m[32m{they}[0m should have [4m[36m{a diversified portfolio}[0m , '' said Jeremy Duffield , a senior vice president of [3m[36m{Vanguard Group}[0m . 
(7) `` [4m[36m{That}[0m means stocks , bonds , money market instruments and real estate . '' 
(8) One week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision . 
(9) But [4m[32m{the latest mutual fund performance figures}[0m do show what can happen when the going gets rough . 
(10) `` You want to [3m[31m{know}[0m how a fund did when [1m[33m{the market}[0m got hammered , '' said [1m[35m{Kurt Brouwer , an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco}[0m . 
(11) `` [3m[31m{It}[0m 's like kicking the tires of [3m[34m{a car}[0m ... . 
(12) What you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's [3m[34m{this car}[0m going to perform ? '' 
(13) General equity funds fell an average of 2.35 % in [32m{the week ended Thursday}[0m , compared with a 2.32 % slide for [36m{the Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index}[0m . 
(14) But [3m[35m{Lipper Analytical 's}[0m figures show that there were a number of ways [3m[35m{investors}[0m could have cushioned [3m[35m{themselves}[0m from [1m[33m{the stock market 's}[0m gyrations . 
(15) Gold - oriented funds , for instance , which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal , posted an average decline of 1.15 % . 
(16) Flexible portfolio funds , which allocate investments among stocks , bonds and money - market instruments and other investments , [4m[32m{declined}[0m at about half the rate of stock funds -- [4m[32m{an average drop of 1.27 %}[0m , according to [3m[35m{Lipper}[0m . 
(17) [34m{Global allocation funds}[0m take the asset - allocation concept one step further by [35m{investing}[0m at least 25 % of [34m{their}[0m portfolios outside the U.S. . 
(18) [35m{This}[0m gives [34m{them}[0m [35m{the added benefits of international diversification}[0m -- including a foreign - exchange boost during periods , like [32m{the past week}[0m , when [4m[31m{the dollar}[0m declines against other major currencies . 
(19) With [35m{all that}[0m going for [3m[34m{them}[0m , [3m[34m{global flexible portfolio funds}[0m declined only 1.07 % in [32m{the week through last Thursday}[0m . 
(20) But while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough , there 's also a price to pay : A diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot . 
(21) And [36m{Friday the 13th}[0m notwithstanding , stocks have been [3m[32m{this year 's}[0m hot investment . 
(22) Thus , even including [32m{the latest week}[0m , the average general stock fund has soared more than 24 % [1m[31m{so far this year}[0m , [4m[32m{the Lipper Analytical figures}[0m show . 
(23) By comparison , global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19 % , while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17 % . 
(24) Fixed - income funds have returned 8.2 % , while gold funds , which tend to be volatile , have risen just 4.55 % , on average . 
(25) `` That 's [3m[33m{the problem with trying to hedge too much}[0m , '' said [1m[35m{Mr. Brouwer}[0m . 
(26) `` You [3m[33m{do}[0m n't make any real money . '' 
(27) Over the last 20 years , for example , [1m[35m{Mr. Brouwer}[0m says , an investor putting $ 5,000 a year in [36m{the S&P 500}[0m would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in Treasury bills . 
(28) Some equity funds did better than others in [32m{the week that began on Friday the 13th}[0m . 
(29) [1m[34m{The $ 4 million Monetta Fund}[0m , for instance , was the seventh top performing fund for [32m{the week}[0m , with a 2.65 % return . 
(30) [1m[34m{Its}[0m return so far this year has been a credible 21.71 % . 
(31) [1m[34m{The fund 's}[0m strategy is to sell when [33m{a stock}[0m appreciates 30 % over [33m{its}[0m cost . 
(32) By the time [1m[33m{the market}[0m [4m[33m{plummeted}[0m 10 days ago , [1m[34m{Monetta}[0m was 55 % in cash , said [4m[34m{Robert Bacarella , president and portfolio manager}[0m . 
(33) [4m[34m{Last Monday}[0m , [4m[34m{he}[0m started `` buying the high - quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices . '' 
(34) Among [4m[34m{Mr. Bacarella 's}[0m picks : Oracle Systems , Reebok International Ltd. and Digital Microwave Corp . 
(35) [1m[34m{The fund 's}[0m cash position is now about 22 % , which [4m[34m{Mr. Bacarella}[0m calls `` still bearish . '' 
(36) Among the big stock funds , [4m[31m{Dreyfus Fund , with more than $ 2 billion in assets ,}[0m had a decline of just 1.49 % for [32m{the week}[0m and a return of 21.42 % for [3m[32m{the year}[0m . 
(37) [1m[32m{Howard Stein , chairman of Dreyfus Corp. ,}[0m said [4m[31m{the fund}[0m was about half invested in government bonds on [36m{Oct. 13}[0m , and about 10 % in cash . 
(38) `` In a downward market , bonds act better , '' [1m[32m{he}[0m said . 
(39) `` [4m[35m{We}[0m still think there 's a lot of unsettlement in [1m[33m{this market}[0m . 
(40) [4m[35m{We}[0m believe interest rates will continue to trend lower , and the economy will slow around the world . '' 
(41) [1m[36m{Many of the funds that did best in the last week}[0m are heavily invested overseas , giving [1m[36m{them}[0m the benefit of foreign currency translations when [4m[31m{the dollar}[0m is weak . 
(42) From [4m[31m{its}[0m high point on [31m{Thursday}[0m , Oct. 12 , to where [4m[31m{it}[0m traded late in New York a week later , [4m[31m{the dollar}[0m fell 3.6 % against the West German mark , 3.4 % against the British pound and 2.1 % against the Japanese yen . 
(43) [1m[31m{Three International Cash Portfolios funds , which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money - market instruments overseas ,}[0m were among the four top - performing funds in [32m{the latest week}[0m . 
(44) Because [1m[31m{the funds '}[0m investments are denominated in [1m[33m{foreign currencies}[0m , [1m[31m{their}[0m value expressed in dollars goes up when [1m[33m{those currencies}[0m rise against [4m[31m{the dollar}[0m . 
(45) But when [4m[31m{the dollar}[0m rises against major foreign currencies , as [4m[31m{it}[0m did for much of [3m[32m{this year}[0m , the dollar value of [1m[31m{these funds}[0m declines . 
(46) [1m[31m{All three funds}[0m posted negative returns for [1m[31m{the year to date}[0m . 
(47) Of the funds that fared the worst in [32m{the post-Oct . 13 week}[0m , [31m{two}[0m are heavily invested in airlines stocks , which led [4m[33m{the market slide}[0m following problems with financing for the UAL Corp . buy - out plan . 
(48) Reflecting airline takeover activity , however , [31m{both the Fidelity Select Air Transportation Portfolio and the National Aviation & Technology fund}[0m posted better - than - average returns for [1m[31m{the the year to date}[0m : 30.09 % for [33m{the Fidelity Air Transportation fund}[0m and a whopping 47.24 % for [4m[35m{National Aviation & Technology}[0m . 
(49) The small drop in equity funds in general in [32m{the latest week}[0m may not necessarily be a good sign , said [4m[36m{A. Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical}[0m . 
(50) Noting that [32m{equity funds}[0m are up nearly 60 % from [32m{their}[0m post-crash low on Dec. 3 , 1987 , [4m[36m{he}[0m said that what happened [34m{last week}[0m `` may not be enough of an adjustment . 
(51) There 's either more to come or an extremely long period of dullness . '' 
(52) But investors do n't seem to think so . 
(53) Several big mutual fund groups said [34m{last week}[0m that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on [36m{the 13th}[0m . 
(54) [3m[36m{Vanguard Group}[0m said [3m[36m{it}[0m had a more than $ 50 million net inflow into [3m[36m{its}[0m stock funds [34m{last week}[0m . 
(55) `` There certainly has n't been a panic reaction , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates . 
(56) `` People showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities . '' 
(57) [3m[35m{Source : Lipper Analytical Services Inc .}[0m
