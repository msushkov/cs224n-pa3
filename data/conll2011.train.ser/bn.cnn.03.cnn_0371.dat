(0) Well , [4m[34m{their}[0m 15 minutes on top of [35m{the world}[0m brought [4m[34m{them}[0m 50 years of fame . 
(1) Today , [4m[32m{Sir Edmund Hillary}[0m being named an honorary citizen of Nepal , to mark [4m[32m{his}[0m historic climb to [4m[35m{the top of Mt. Everest}[0m with [4m[33m{Sherpa Norgay}[0m . 
(2) There is concern climbing [36m{Everest}[0m has become too common , and perhaps a bit too commercial . 
(3) [33m{I}[0m do n't think we have [1m[32m{that}[0m . 
(4) We do n't have anything to demonstrate [1m[32m{that commercialality}[0m . 
(5) All right , let [31m{'s}[0m show you a little bit of [36m{Mt. Everest , the highest summit on the planet}[0m . 
(6) [4m[36m{Some 3D imagery .}[0m 
(7) There , you see , the big picture of [34m{the southern part of Asia}[0m . 
(8) [31m{We}[0m 'll bring you down into [32m{the Himilayas}[0m . 
(9) 20 million years ago , [32m{they}[0m were formed when India broke off what was then a piece of Africa and slammed into [34m{that portion of Asia}[0m , creating [32m{this tremendous mountain range , with of course Mt. Everest at 29,000 feet above sea level}[0m . 
(10) [36m{The highest peak of them all .}[0m 
(11) [4m[36m{This 3D animation}[0m kind of exaggerates it a little bit . 
(12) What [33m{I}[0m should tell you is there are about 15 possible routes to get you to [4m[35m{the top of Mt. Everest}[0m . 
(13) What [4m[32m{Sir Edmund Hillary}[0m did and [4m[33m{Norgay}[0m did was go along this route that takes [4m[34m{them}[0m across this valley -- 
(14) You have to turn [4m[36m{the picture}[0m this way a little bit , shoot back over this range , and bring you up in here . 
(15) Then [33m{I}[0m 'll try to give you [33m{my}[0m best guesstimation . 
(16) Basically , right along this ridge line up to 29,000 feet , into thin air , as it was popularly coined by the book by the name of John Crack Cower a few years ago . 
(17) Since that , a lot of people have tried , a lot of people have succeeded . 
(18) 175 people have died trying to reach [4m[35m{the summit of Mt. Everest}[0m . 
(19) [31m{We}[0m 're joined by [31m{our}[0m guest -- where is [31m{our}[0m guest , by the way ? who is in Kathmandu . 
(20) And how 's the party going there ? 
(21) Are [1m[33m{you}[0m there ?
