(0) [4m[31m{The White House}[0m called on [3m[33m{Congress}[0m to [3m[31m{attach}[0m [3m[34m{the proposed capital - gains tax cut}[0m to [3m[33m{its}[0m final deficit - reduction bill , but lawmakers seem likely to balk at [3m[31m{the idea}[0m . 
(1) Earlier this month , [4m[31m{the White House}[0m endorsed stripping [3m[34m{the controversial tax measure}[0m from [3m[35m{the bill}[0m so that [3m[33m{Congress}[0m could pass quickly [3m[35m{a `` clean '' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm - Rudman act}[0m . 
(2) But now that [3m[33m{Congress}[0m has missed the legal deadline for meeting the [4m[32m{Gramm - Rudman}[0m targets , [4m[31m{the White House}[0m said [4m[31m{it}[0m has returned to [4m[31m{its}[0m original view that [3m[34m{a capital - gains cut}[0m should [4m[36m{be}[0m part of [3m[35m{the deficit - reduction bill , on which Congress continues to work}[0m . 
(3) `` If [4m[36m{that}[0m does n't happen , then [4m[31m{we}[0m press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote , '' said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater . 
(4) On Capitol Hill , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and [3m[35m{the deficit - reduction bill}[0m . 
(5) [4m[33m{Texas Rep. William Archer , the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee}[0m said , `` [4m[33m{I}[0m do n't see how [3m[32m{we}[0m have the votes '' to place [3m[34m{a capital - gains tax cut}[0m there . 
(6) Meanwhile , [4m[35m{President Bush}[0m stepped up [4m[35m{his}[0m personal lobbying for [3m[34m{the capital - gains tax cut}[0m . 
(7) [4m[31m{The White House}[0m said [4m[35m{he}[0m plans to hold a series of private [4m[31m{White House}[0m meetings , mostly with [31m{Senate}[0m Democrats , to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind [3m[34m{the tax cut}[0m . 
(8) The first meeting yesterday was with [4m[34m{10 Senate Democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax}[0m . 
(9) According to some who attended , [4m[34m{the senators}[0m [32m{argued}[0m that [4m[35m{the president}[0m should give [3m[36m{the Democratic leaders in Congress}[0m a victory of [3m[36m{their}[0m own to compensate [3m[36m{them}[0m for allowing [4m[35m{the president}[0m to win on the controversial capital - gains issue . 
(10) Issues discussed in [32m{this context}[0m were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child - care spending . 
(11) [4m[35m{The president}[0m was said to have been noncommittal .
