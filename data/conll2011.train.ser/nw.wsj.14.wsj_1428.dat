(0) [4m[36m{OPEC 's}[0m ability to produce more petroleum than [4m[36m{it}[0m can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets . 
(1) Output from [4m[36m{the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries}[0m is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out . 
(2) But industry and [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m officials agree that a handful of [3m[33m{members}[0m still have enough unused capacity to glut [32m{the market}[0m and cause an oil - price collapse a few months from now if [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral [4m[36m{its}[0m chronic cheaters . 
(3) As a result , the effort by some oil ministers to get [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m to approve a new permanent production - sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency . 
(4) [4m[36m{The organization}[0m is scheduled to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25 . 
(5) So far this year , rising demand for [1m[33m{OPEC oil}[0m and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by [1m[34m{others}[0m . 
(6) But that could change if demand for [4m[36m{OPEC 's}[0m oil softens seasonally early next year as some think may happen . 
(7) [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m is currently producing [33m{more than 22 million barrels a day}[0m , sharply above [4m[36m{its}[0m nominal , self - imposed fourth - quarter ceiling of 20.5 million , according to [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m and industry officials at [4m[32m{an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune}[0m . 
(8) At [33m{that rate}[0m , [32m{a majority of OPEC 's 13 members}[0m have reached [32m{their}[0m output limits , [1m[32m{they}[0m said . 
(9) But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m . 
(10) Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries , including [4m[35m{his}[0m own , [4m[35m{Issam Al - Chalabi , Iraq 's oil minister ,}[0m told [4m[32m{the conference}[0m Friday . 
(11) [4m[35m{He}[0m puts [4m[36m{OPEC 's}[0m current capacity at [34m{28 million to 29 million barrels a day}[0m . 
(12) [34m{That}[0m 's higher than some other estimates . 
(13) Ali Khalifa Al - Sabah , [36m{Kuwait 's}[0m oil minister , recently estimated [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m capacity at 25 million barrels a day . 
(14) Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge . 
(15) Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as [4m[33m{Saudi Arabia}[0m and [31m{Iraq}[0m , could upset [32m{the market}[0m . 
(16) [4m[35m{The Iraqi oil minister}[0m and [4m[31m{Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer}[0m insisted in [3m[32m{their}[0m comments to [4m[32m{the conference}[0m that [3m[32m{their}[0m countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market . 
(17) However , in interviews later , [3m[32m{both ministers}[0m stressed that [3m[32m{they}[0m expect future [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of [3m[33m{each member}[0m . 
(18) Under that approach , [35m{countries with the most unused oil capacity}[0m would get bigger shares of any future increases in [4m[36m{OPEC 's}[0m production ceiling than [35m{they}[0m would under the current system . 
(19) `` If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can produce at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked [4m[35m{Mr. Al - Chalabi}[0m . 
(20) At an inconclusive [31m{Geneva}[0m meeting late last month , [4m[36m{OPEC 's}[0m oil ministers halfheartedly approved [1m[36m{another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling}[0m . 
(21) [3m[31m{They}[0m doled [1m[36m{it}[0m out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official allotments . 
(22) The main effect of [1m[36m{the ceiling boost}[0m was to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from [1m[34m{the quota cheaters}[0m . 
(23) Still , there was a breakthrough at [31m{Geneva}[0m . 
(24) Previously , [1m[31m{no OPEC member}[0m had been willing to accept a reduction in [1m[31m{its}[0m percentage share of [4m[36m{the group 's}[0m total output target , or ceiling . 
(25) But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced there in [34m{an Iranian proposal}[0m , was generally endorsed by [3m[31m{the ministers}[0m . 
(26) In the end politics got in the way . 
(27) [4m[34m{Libya}[0m accepted [35m{Iran 's}[0m proposal only so long as [4m[34m{it}[0m was promised production parity with [36m{Kuwait}[0m . 
(28) And [4m[36m{the United Arab Emirates , a chronic quota cheater ,}[0m refused to give any guarantee [4m[36m{it}[0m would change [4m[36m{its}[0m ways . 
(29) But [3m[31m{the oil ministers}[0m continue to study [34m{the plan}[0m , and [34m{it}[0m will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting . 
(30) It 's understood several compromises already have been worked into [34m{the plan}[0m . 
(31) [3m[35m{The ceiling}[0m would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide [36m{Kuwait}[0m and [4m[36m{the United Arab Emirates}[0m much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others . 
(32) [4m[34m{Libya 's}[0m previous conditions are no longer considered a problem , although [4m[36m{the United Arab Emirates}[0m is still an issue . 
(33) [4m[33m{Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin ,}[0m also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m sources said . 
(34) Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , [3m[34m{Saudi officials}[0m have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to [3m[33m{all members}[0m . 
(35) In [31m{Geneva}[0m , however , [3m[34m{they}[0m supported [35m{Iran 's}[0m proposal because [34m{it}[0m would have left the Saudi percentage of [3m[35m{the OPEC total}[0m intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million . 
(36) Some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on [4m[33m{Saudi Arabia}[0m to `` give back '' to the production - sharing pool [33m{a token 23,000 barrels}[0m . 
(37) Though tiny , [33m{that}[0m 's a reduction in [4m[33m{its}[0m share . 
(38) [4m[31m{Mr. Nazer , the Saudi oil minister ,}[0m reiterated here that [4m[33m{the kingdom}[0m would insist on maintaining [4m[33m{its}[0m percentage share of [4m[36m{OPEC}[0m production under any quota revisions . 
(39) `` Under any circumstances , [4m[33m{Saudi Arabia}[0m should get more '' rather than less , [4m[31m{Mr. Nazer}[0m said .
