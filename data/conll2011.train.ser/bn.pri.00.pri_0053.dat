(0) Neither candidate will be declared the President - elect until [3m[35m{at least Friday}[0m . 
(1) [3m[35m{That}[0m 's when the overseas ballots will be counted and factored into the candidates ' final totals . 
(2) [1m[36m{The World 's}[0m Jennifer Glass reports from [4m[34m{London}[0m . 
(3) There are Floridians all over [1m[33m{the world}[0m . 
(4) Because abroad are n't counted in our census , no one knows how many , and no one knows how many voted . 
(5) Those who did it like [4m[31m{Margaret Sawn , an American working in Costa Rica}[0m , says [4m[31m{she}[0m is glad a week and a half before Americans in [4m[33m{the United States}[0m went to the polls that [4m[31m{she}[0m cast [4m[31m{her}[0m absentee ballot for George Bush . 
(6) Well , because , you know , [3m[32m{Gore}[0m was going after the outer voters very hard , [4m[31m{I}[0m did feel Friday would be important , and , of course [4m[31m{I}[0m did n't think , it would get down to this but who would n't . 
(7) Here in [4m[34m{London}[0m , [33m{Frances Deek}[0m is a retired teacher who lived in Britain for 18 years . 
(8) [33m{She}[0m says [33m{she}[0m cast [33m{her}[0m absentee ballot for [3m[32m{Al Gore}[0m . 
(9) [33m{Deek}[0m says in recent days , [33m{she}[0m has had to defend [4m[33m{the United States 's}[0m political system . 
(10) [1m[32m{Britains who notice she is American}[0m , have let [33m{her}[0m know what [1m[32m{they}[0m think of [31m{the elections}[0m . 
(11) [1m[32m{They}[0m keep saying , " Oh , is n't that terrible . 
(12) [4m[33m{The biggest democracy in the world}[0m and [4m[33m{it}[0m 's all falling apart . 
(13) And [33m{I}[0m say it is because [4m[33m{we}[0m are a democracy that [31m{it}[0m 's happening this way . 
(14) It 's because everybody gets the vote . 
(15) It 's because [4m[32m{people}[0m will not let things slide . 
(16) [4m[32m{They}[0m want to know everything . 
(17) This is part of being a democracy . 
(18) But for Americans abroad , says [33m{Geek}[0m , participating in democracy [1m[35m{voting}[0m is more work then for Americans in [4m[33m{the United States}[0m . 
(19) You have to make a very conscious effort and it takes mailing two things to get to vote . 
(20) You have to send in your card to start with , and then when you get the ballot bag , you have to send the ballot back . 
(21) So , [1m[35m{it}[0m 's harder than if you just wandered up to your poll on Election Day and voted because you have been registered for years . 
(22) In the Israeli town of Ramad Beithshamuz , [32m{Karen London originally from Hollywood , Florida ,}[0m says [4m[36m{she and her husband}[0m almost did n't vote . 
(23) [32m{Her}[0m ballot arrived late . 
(24) [32m{Her}[0m husband said voting was a waste of time , but [32m{she}[0m insisted and mailed [4m[36m{their}[0m ballots . 
(25) Now [32m{London}[0m says [32m{she}[0m is glad [32m{she}[0m did n't listen to [32m{her}[0m husband and so is [3m[33m{he}[0m . 
(26) [32m{I}[0m did n't think anything of it and so when [32m{my}[0m grandson called Wednesday morning to say , ' Wake up , today [4m[36m{your}[0m vote is going to count ' , then it was really a matter of , you know , [4m[36m{our}[0m vote not only does [3m[31m{it}[0m count like [3m[31m{it}[0m shows in any election , but [3m[31m{it}[0m really counts in the final and [4m[36m{we}[0m voted an absentee ballot . 
(27) But [4m[36m{Londons}[0m did n't say which way [4m[36m{they}[0m voted but [4m[36m{they}[0m have cast ballots in each of the three Presidential elections held since [4m[36m{they}[0m moved to Israel 9 years ago . 
(28) This year , says [32m{Karen}[0m , has been special and a little frightening . 
(29) It 's quite a daunting feeling to think that , you know , of hundreds and millions of people , you know , in this case [4m[36m{our}[0m vote counts , although [3m[31m{it}[0m does n't count more than any other citizen 's vote , in this particular moment [3m[31m{it}[0m counts more than everybody else 's , because [3m[31m{that}[0m 's what they are waiting for . 
(30) [1m[34m{Major Mikiang , a Floridian based in Germany}[0m is from Okichobee County , [3m[36m{Florida}[0m . 
(31) [1m[34m{He}[0m says despite the waiting , the court cases and the uncertainty , [1m[34m{he}[0m is not worried that there 'll be a constitutional crisis in [4m[33m{the United States}[0m . 
(32) [1m[34m{I}[0m do n't really have any concerns at all . 
(33) [1m[34m{I}[0m am very confident that [4m[33m{our}[0m form of government that checks and balances the way [4m[33m{we}[0m set [3m[34m{the process}[0m up and the way [3m[34m{it}[0m is moving , so many things to fall back on to keep [3m[34m{the process}[0m moving , that [1m[34m{I}[0m am not really concerned at all . 
(34) One radio announcer here in [4m[34m{London}[0m made an accurate and insightful comment today . 
(35) At a time like this with the Presidency hanging in the balance , in many nations the generals have moved in . 
(36) In [4m[33m{America}[0m the lawyers do . 
(37) For [1m[36m{the World}[0m , [4m[35m{I}[0m am Jennifer Glass in [4m[34m{London}[0m .
