(0) Some breaking news out of Fort Worth , [1m[35m{Texas}[0m , tonight . 
(1) A big shake - up at [36m{American Airlines}[0m . 
(2) Let 's turn to [1m[34m{Gregg Clarkin who is on the ground in Texas with the very latest}[0m . 
(3) Good evening , [1m[34m{Gregg}[0m . 
(4) What happened ? 
(5) Reporter : 
(6) Good evening , [1m[36m{Paula}[0m . 
(7) A management blunder we heard an awful lot about on behalf of [35m{Donald Carty , the CEO of American Airlines ' parent company AMR}[0m has cost [35m{Carty}[0m [35m{his}[0m job . 
(8) [31m{The company}[0m announcing that [35m{Donald Carty}[0m is out as [3m[33m{CEO}[0m . 
(9) [35m{He}[0m 'll be replaced by Gerald Aftery . 
(10) [35m{Carty}[0m , if you recall has been pressuring [3m[35m{unions}[0m over the last couple of months to accept steep pay cuts , cutting back [3m[35m{their}[0m vacation time and holiday pay , as well , saying [31m{the company}[0m needed [32m{these concessions}[0m at bankruptcy court . 
(11) No sooner did [3m[35m{the unions}[0m agree to [32m{these concessions}[0m than it became known that [35m{Carty}[0m and some of [35m{his}[0m top executives had been [3m[32m{given}[0m a bit of a package of perks , perks that included a trust fund to protect some of the pensions in the event of a bankruptcy as well as retention bonuses . 
(12) When [3m[35m{the unions}[0m learned of [3m[32m{that}[0m [3m[35m{they}[0m became outraged and said confidence and trust in [35m{Carty}[0m was damaged without repair . 
(13) [35m{Carty}[0m is out as [3m[33m{CEO of AMR , the parent of American , the world 's largest airline}[0m . 
(14) One other topic still to be decided , bankruptcy . 
(15) [31m{The company}[0m saying if [31m{they}[0m do n't get the flight attendants to concede to a special offer , [31m{they}[0m will indeed file for bankruptcy . 
(16) Back to [1m[36m{you}[0m . 
(17) Thank [1m[34m{you}[0m very much . 
(18) [35m{The chief executive of the world 's largest airline}[0m has [1m[31m{resigned}[0m , [1m[31m{not a completely unexpected move because several board members talked about wanting him to leave}[0m . 
(19) [33m{We}[0m will move on to other material now . 
(20) As [33m{we}[0m 've been reporting , nobody seems to know for sure if [34m{Saddam Hussein}[0m is dead or alive . 
(21) Whatever [34m{his}[0m fate , [34m{he}[0m left behind [1m[32m{some videos , home videos , in fact}[0m . 
(22) [3m[34m{Bruce Burkhart}[0m has taken a look and [3m[34m{he}[0m says [1m[32m{they}[0m show a very different side of [34m{a former Iraqi ruler}[0m . 
(23) Reporter : 
(24) Who was [34m{that nice man strolling with his wife}[0m ? 
(25) Yes , [34m{it}[0m 's him , the cruel and ruthless Iraqi dictator , Saddam Hussein . 
(26) All warm , fuzzy . 
(27) Romanticly strolling with [34m{his}[0m first wife on a snowy path . 
(28) Trendy leather coat , furry hat . 
(29) Gently kissing [3m[31m{her}[0m good-bye like a good husband at the now famous Saddam Hussein International Airport . 
(30) Tailored suit . 
(31) Shyly a modest cake for [34m{his}[0m 50th birthday . 
(32) Happily chatting with peasants behind the wheel of [34m{his}[0m white Mercedes . 
(33) Well , this is not an episode of Joe Dictator , or an Iraqi version of The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous . 
(34) [1m[32m{These}[0m are videotapes from the '80s found in a palace of [34m{Saddam Hussein 's}[0m first wife . 
(35) Bizarre imagery almost surreal , but a reminder that even brutal dictators have a private --
