(0) 01:45 Universal Time . 
(1) This is [34m{VOA}[0m News now . 
(2) [1m[31m{A new and simple blood test}[0m may soon be available to help [1m[32m{doctors}[0m tell which of [1m[32m{their}[0m diabetic patients is most likely to develop crippling and life - threatening complications . 
(3) [34m{VOA 's}[0m Jessica Berman explains . 
(4) [1m[36m{Researcher Andrew Levi}[0m says scientists have long been puzzled by the question of which diabetics develop [32m{complications}[0m and why . 
(5) We know that [32m{the complications}[0m are directly related to a couple of things . 
(6) One is how long you 've had [1m[33m{the diabetes}[0m , how well you 've been controlled , but it 's clear that [36m{people with the same level of control of their glucose , same duration of the diabetes}[0m differ dramatically in [36m{their}[0m susceptibility to [32m{these complications that are so devastating}[0m . 
(7) [1m[36m{Dr. Levi}[0m says one third of insulin taking patients ends up with kidney failure and 80 % develop blinding eye disease . 
(8) Scientists have suspected there must be [35m{something different about the genetic make - up of diabetics who develop complications}[0m ; and [35m{that difference}[0m may have to do with haptoglobin , a protein whose function is to mop up [1m[35m{blood vessel destroying free radicals}[0m . 
(9) [1m[35m{The free radicals}[0m are released when oxygen carrying red blood cells called haemoglobin die . 
(10) [1m[36m{Andrew Levi}[0m says there are three different types of haptoglobin and [1m[36m{he}[0m and [1m[36m{his}[0m colleagues at [1m[34m{Israel 's Technion Institute}[0m have found that one type of haptoglobin called Type 1 - 1 appears protective against diabetic complications while the other two types do not . 
(11) [33m{Researchers at Technion Institute led by Dr. Levi}[0m have developed [1m[31m{a simple blood test to let doctors and patients know who is most likely to develop diabetic complications}[0m .
