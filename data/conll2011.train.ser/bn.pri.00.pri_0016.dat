(0) This is [32m{The World , a co-production of the BBC World Service , PRI and WGBH in Boston}[0m . 
(1) [1m[36m{I}[0m am Tony Kahn . 
(2) The drama in [3m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m seemed to climax last thursday when hundreds of thousands of protesters forced the ouster of [3m[31m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m , but now the events of last week are beginning to look like act I . 
(3) Talks [4m[34m{today}[0m between [35m{supporters of Yugoslavia 's new President Vojislav Kostunica}[0m and members of [3m[31m{the Milosevic 's}[0m Socialist Party yielded more heat than light . 
(4) [31m{Kostunica 's}[0m people accused [34m{the Socialists}[0m of trying to hold on to the institutions of power and as if on cue , it was announced that [34m{a key Milosevic loyalist}[0m is taking over the Interior Ministry , which runs the police . 
(5) [32m{The World 's}[0m Nenad Chebeck is in [4m[33m{Belgrade}[0m . 
(6) [35m{Nenad}[0m , what do [4m[31m{we}[0m know of [34m{this Milosevic ally}[0m ? 
(7) Well , [34m{it}[0m 's Mirco Merianovic who officially still is the Prime Minister of [36m{Serbia}[0m . 
(8) We have to keep one thing in mind that [31m{Vojislav Kostunica}[0m and the pro-democracy elements in [36m{Serbia}[0m and [3m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m have taken over authority on [1m[34m{the federal level}[0m , but the key leaders of power are on the republican level . 
(9) [3m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m consists of two republics , [36m{Serbia}[0m and Montenegro and there were no elections for neither the Serbian parliament , nor the presidency , so [36m{the Serbian government}[0m officially is still in place . 
(10) But that 's all theory . 
(11) In practice things are slightly different . 
(12) The whole structure of power in [36m{Serbia}[0m and [3m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m was based on [3m[31m{one man , Milosevic}[0m . 
(13) Once [3m[31m{he}[0m collapsed , politically and [3m[31m{he}[0m has collapsed when [3m[31m{he}[0m resigned officially on national television , all the old structures of power collapsed together with [3m[31m{him}[0m . 
(14) Well , since , although , officially you got two different parallel governments going on , the reality is that [31m{Mr. Kostunica}[0m is trying to [33m{consolidate}[0m [31m{his}[0m power over [3m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m , what other indications are there that [31m{he}[0m is having trouble doing [33m{that}[0m ? 
(15) [4m[36m{The taking over of all the leaders of power}[0m for [31m{Mr. Kostunica}[0m and [31m{his}[0m allies is a process which definitely takes time . 
(16) Everybody is impatient , especially here in [4m[33m{Belgrade}[0m and [36m{Serbia}[0m . 
(17) The people that [35m{I}[0m see on the street and that [35m{I}[0m hear from are sick and tired of [3m[31m{Milosevic}[0m cronies appearing on television protesting against [4m[36m{this}[0m and trying to hang on to whatever little power [4m[32m{they}[0m have at the moment . 
(18) However , [31m{Mr. Kostunica}[0m and [3m[36m{the Democratic Alliance of Serbia}[0m has said very openly [4m[34m{today}[0m that [3m[35m{they}[0m will not put up with this kind of behavior for much longer . 
(19) [3m[35m{They}[0m have indeed threatened [3m[31m{Milosevic}[0m allies that [3m[35m{they}[0m are going to bring out the people onto the streets again so that a completely new authority can be established , not just on [1m[34m{the federal level}[0m , but also on the level of [36m{the Republic of Serbia}[0m . 
(20) Let 's talk a little bit also about other important policies of [3m[32m{the government}[0m , of importance to people outside [3m[32m{Yugoslavia}[0m , and that is [1m[32m{Kosovo}[0m . 
(21) There has been [32m{some news coming out that Yugoslav troops are going to return to Kosovo by the end of the year}[0m . 
(22) What can [35m{you}[0m tell us about what [3m[32m{this new government}[0m will do in [1m[32m{that area}[0m ? 
(23) Well , [32m{it}[0m is a report that was brought by [4m[34m{today 's}[0m edition of [36m{Vetrivinia Novostate , a Belgrade newspaper}[0m . 
(24) [36m{They}[0m quoted Zoran Zingic , one of the main leaders in [3m[36m{the Democratic Alliance}[0m saying that Yugoslav troops and police will be policing [1m[33m{the borders between Kosovo and other countries , meaning Macedonia and Albania}[0m . 
(25) Basically [32m{it}[0m is not such a threatening sort of bit of a news as it might seem at the moment because [1m[35m{the United Nations resolution , 1244 ,}[0m does actually provide for the presence of Yugoslav troops and police on [1m[33m{the borders}[0m . 
(26) That part of [1m[35m{the resolution here}[0m and [1m[35m{the resolution}[0m was never actually applied because right until now , the Yugoslav police and military were in the hands of [3m[31m{Milosevic}[0m , so [4m[35m{the international community}[0m did n't want to have anything to do with the [3m[31m{Milosevic}[0m forces . 
(27) Well , how is [4m[35m{the international community}[0m dealing at [1m[31m{this point}[0m with the change of [3m[32m{the government}[0m ? 
(28) Who is there and what kind of assistance are [3m[34m{they}[0m offering or what is the symbolic value of [3m[34m{their}[0m being there at [1m[31m{this point}[0m ? 
(29) Well , at the moment it is a race , who is going to get to [4m[33m{Belgrade}[0m first . 
(30) Yesterday , we had the French Foreign Minister , [4m[34m{today}[0m we have Budor Homback , who is the head of [4m[35m{the international community 's}[0m Stability Pact for Southeast Europe . 
(31) We also saw the American diplomat Willie Montgomery who arrived in [4m[33m{Belgrade}[0m [4m[34m{today}[0m to set up most probably a meeting between [3m[33m{a senior U.S. official James O'brien , who is coming to Belgrade}[0m . 
(32) [3m[33m{He}[0m will be here tomorrow as a special representative for President Clinton . 
(33) [3m[33m{He}[0m will hold talks , probably behind closed doors , with [31m{President Vojislav Kostunica}[0m , but [33m{the United States}[0m is keeping a low profile because there is quite a lot of anti-American sentiment on the streets here in [36m{Serbia}[0m . 
(34) So [35m{I}[0m believe that [33m{Washington}[0m realizes that very open support for [31m{Mr. Vojislav Kostunica}[0m could do [31m{the man}[0m more harm than good at this moment . 
(35) [32m{The World 's}[0m Nenad Chebeck in [4m[33m{Belgrade}[0m . 
(36) Thank [35m{you}[0m very much for speaking with [4m[31m{us}[0m . 
(37) [1m[36m{You}[0m are welcome [1m[36m{Tony}[0m .
