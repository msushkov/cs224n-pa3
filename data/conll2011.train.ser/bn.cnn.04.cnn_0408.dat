(0) Seven minutes before the top of the hour . 
(1) At the beginning [1m[31m{we}[0m told about this incredible story about [31m{the rescue of three fishermen in the waters off the coast of Vancouver , stuck in the waters , gale force winds , small boat}[0m . 
(2) [3m[31m{They}[0m were [31m{rescued}[0m by [4m[34m{a cruise ship that happened to be in the neighborhood}[0m . 
(3) [3m[31m{Those three men}[0m did n't realize how lucky [3m[31m{they}[0m were until [3m[31m{they}[0m were plucked out of [35m{the water}[0m . 
(4) [1m[31m{We}[0m have with [1m[31m{us}[0m [4m[31m{Captain Kent Ringboard , on board the Royal Caribbean `` Radiance of the Seas}[0m . '' 
(5) [3m[34m{I}[0m understand [4m[31m{you}[0m were on [4m[32m{board}[0m when [31m{this rescue}[0m happened . 
(6) Were [4m[31m{you}[0m in [32m{charge}[0m ? 
(7) Yes , that 's correct [4m[31m{I}[0m was in [32m{charge}[0m . 
(8) Tell [1m[31m{us}[0m about what happened here . 
(9) What was it [4m[31m{you}[0m were looking at when [4m[31m{you}[0m looked out over [35m{the waters}[0m ? 
(10) Well , it was quite windy , [4m[35m{gusty winds up to 40 , 50 miles an hour}[0m , and [4m[35m{it}[0m came from southeast , and [3m[33m{we}[0m got the alarm this distress situation just before 5:00 in the morning , and [3m[33m{we}[0m were on relatively slow speed for the time being , but [3m[33m{we}[0m of course , speeded up to the position , which was given , and after an hour , [3m[33m{we}[0m spotted [33m{the fishing boat}[0m in [35m{the waters}[0m . 
(11) [3m[31m{These men}[0m were in [35m{some water that was quite frigid}[0m . 
(12) If [3m[31m{they}[0m stayed out there for long [3m[31m{they}[0m could have suffered severe tragedy , perhaps . 
(13) [3m[34m{I}[0m want to ask [4m[31m{you}[0m , Have [4m[31m{you}[0m ever done anything like [31m{this}[0m ? Have [4m[31m{you}[0m ever seen anything like [31m{this}[0m done ? 
(14) No , [4m[31m{I}[0m have never seen [3m[36m{this type of operation where you have a fishing vessel disappear , more or less , and that the survivors , they had to go into the water , pick them up from the water}[0m . 
(15) Was there any point at which [4m[31m{you}[0m did n't think [3m[33m{you}[0m would be able to pull [31m{it}[0m off ? 
(16) Sorry , please say again ? 
(17) Was there any point at which [4m[31m{you}[0m thought [3m[33m{you}[0m would n't be able to [36m{pull}[0m [31m{it}[0m off ? 
(18) No , absolutely not . 
(19) we were 100 % sure [3m[33m{we}[0m could make it , absolutely , because [3m[33m{we}[0m came very close to [33m{the vessel}[0m , [3m[33m{we}[0m had [3m[33m{our}[0m rescue boat out soon . 
(20) So [4m[31m{I}[0m felt confident about [36m{it}[0m . 
(21) [4m[31m{I}[0m saw [3m[31m{the fishermen}[0m also [3m[32m{had}[0m the surviving suits on , so [3m[32m{that}[0m gave [4m[31m{me}[0m more time to help . 
(22) [3m[32m{That}[0m was a good thing for [3m[31m{them}[0m . 
(23) What about [4m[31m{your}[0m crew that was actually involved in [31m{the rescue here}[0m ? are [4m[33m{they}[0m trained for [3m[36m{this sort of thing}[0m ? 
(24) Yes , [4m[33m{they}[0m are very much well - trained . 
(25) [3m[33m{We}[0m train for [3m[36m{this type of operation}[0m at least every 14 days . 
(26) [3m[34m{I}[0m 'm hopeful [3m[31m{those three fishermen}[0m bought [4m[31m{you}[0m a glass of wine once [4m[31m{you}[0m got [3m[31m{them}[0m on [4m[32m{board}[0m . 
(27) [3m[33m{We}[0m gave [3m[31m{them}[0m some . 
(28) [4m[36m{These incredible pictures .}[0m 
(29) [3m[34m{I}[0m 'm not sure if [4m[31m{you}[0m have been able to see some of [4m[36m{these pictures playing on the television sets around the world}[0m but we look at [4m[36m{these pictures}[0m and think there 's no way a cruise ship , as big as it is , will be able to maneuver into position in these kinds of heavy seas to save [3m[31m{three corks out there on the water}[0m . 
(30) Amazing . 
(31) It was interesting , but [3m[33m{we}[0m had a good maneuvering capability on .
