(0) [36m{Maggie Thatcher}[0m must be doing something right ; [36m{her}[0m political enemies are screaming louder than ever . 
(1) [36m{Mrs. Thatcher , who was practicing the read - my - lips school of politics years before Mr. Bush encountered it ,}[0m has made clear [36m{her}[0m opposition to refashioning [4m[36m{Britain 's}[0m free - market policies to suit the bureaucrats in Brussels . 
(2) In return , [36m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m is excoriated from Fleet Street to Paris as an obstructionist . 
(3) Well , it now turns out that [36m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m had to travel across the globe to the 49 - member [35m{Commonwealth}[0m summit in Kuala Lumpur to discomfit the Holy Order of Consensus Builders . 
(4) `` A disastrous farce in [1m[33m{Malaysia}[0m , '' screamed [31m{the Manchester Guardian}[0m . 
(5) `` [36m{She}[0m can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad . '' 
(6) Egad . 
(7) Canada 's Brian Mulroney and Australia 's Bob Hawke , [31m{the paper}[0m said , were `` enraged . '' 
(8) The London Times said [36m{she}[0m had `` contravened protocol . '' 
(9) As usual , [36m{her}[0m sin was saying what [36m{she}[0m thought . 
(10) [36m{She}[0m issued [1m[32m{a separate statement}[0m , separating [36m{herself}[0m from a [35m{Commonwealth}[0m document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against [34m{South Africa}[0m . 
(11) While supporting [35m{the Commonwealth}[0m `` in utterly condemning apartheid , '' [36m{her}[0m statement urged [35m{it}[0m to `` encourage change '' rather than inflict further punishment on [34m{the country 's}[0m black population . 
(12) Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions : In May a Gallup Poll found that most South African blacks , 85 % , oppose economic sanctions . 
(13) Still , [36m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m had once again gone against the grain . 
(14) [1m[33m{Malaysia 's}[0m Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sniffed , `` If [1m[34m{everybody else}[0m puts out [1m[34m{their}[0m left foot and you put out your right foot , you are out of step . '' 
(15) [36m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m : `` If it 's one against [32m{48}[0m , [36m{I}[0m 'm very sorry for [32m{the 48}[0m . '' 
(16) If indeed [36m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m has [4m[35m{one opponent that could throw her off political course}[0m [4m[35m{it}[0m is [4m[36m{Britain 's}[0m mysteriously intractable inflation problem . 
(17) We can not , however , join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that [36m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m refuses to get along by going along . 
(18) It is refreshing to see [36m{at least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs}[0m . 
(19) Perhaps [36m{Mrs. Thatcher}[0m understands better than those distressed at [36m{her}[0m style that ultimately history and [4m[36m{Britain 's}[0m voters will decide who is right about Europe , sanctioning [34m{South Africa}[0m or running [4m[36m{Britain 's}[0m economy .
