(0) [33m{Israel}[0m has launched a new effort to prove [4m[35m{the Palestine Liberation Organization}[0m continues to practice terrorism , and thus to persuade [3m[31m{the U.S.}[0m to break off talks with [4m[35m{the group}[0m . 
(1) [3m[34m{U.S. officials}[0m , however , said [3m[34m{they}[0m are n't buying the Israeli argument . 
(2) [1m[35m{Israeli counterterrorism officials}[0m provided [34m{the State Department}[0m with [1m[32m{a 20 - page list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat}[0m . 
(3) [3m[33m{Mr. Arafat}[0m publicly renounced terrorism [35m{Dec. 15}[0m , satisfying the U.S. precondition for a direct `` dialogue '' with [4m[35m{the PLO}[0m . 
(4) [36m{A U.S. counterterrorism official}[0m said experts are studying [1m[32m{the Israeli list}[0m . 
(5) `` [3m[32m{We}[0m have no independent evidence linking [1m[34m{Fatah}[0m to any acts of terrorism since [35m{Dec. 15 , 1988}[0m , '' [36m{he}[0m said , referring to [1m[34m{the specific PLO group that Mr. Arafat heads}[0m . 
(6) `` So far , [1m[32m{this list}[0m does n't change [3m[32m{our}[0m view . 
(7) [33m{Israel}[0m wants to end [3m[36m{the dialogue}[0m , but [3m[32m{our}[0m analysts take a different view than [33m{theirs}[0m . '' 
(8) [4m[33m{Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 's top adviser on counterterrorism , Yigal Carmon ,}[0m was here Monday to present [1m[32m{the report}[0m to members of Congress , reporters and others . 
(9) [4m[33m{Mr. Carmon}[0m said [4m[33m{he}[0m also presented [1m[32m{the list}[0m last week to William Brown , U.S. Ambassador to [33m{Israel}[0m . 
(10) Separately , [1m[31m{the New York Times}[0m reported that [4m[36m{the Israeli government}[0m had provided [1m[31m{its}[0m correspondent in Jerusalem with [4m[31m{different documents that Israel said prove the PLO has been conducting terrorism from the occupied Arab territories}[0m . 
(11) [34m{The State Department}[0m said [34m{it}[0m has n't yet seen copies of [4m[31m{those papers}[0m . 
(12) `` If [3m[36m{the dialogue}[0m was based on the assumption that [3m[33m{Arafat}[0m or [4m[35m{the PLO}[0m would stop terrorism , and [4m[36m{we}[0m have evidence of continued terrorism , what would be the logical conclusion ? '' [4m[33m{Mr. Carmon}[0m asked . 
(13) [33m{Israel}[0m has long claimed [3m[33m{Mr. Arafat}[0m never meant to renounce terrorism , particularly because [3m[33m{he}[0m and [3m[33m{his}[0m lieutenants reserved the right to press `` armed struggle '' against [33m{the Jewish state}[0m . 
(14) Now , [33m{Jerusalem}[0m says [33m{it}[0m is backing up [33m{its}[0m contention with detailed accounts of [32m{alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to Mr. Arafat}[0m . 
(15) [33m{It}[0m blames most of [32m{these}[0m on [1m[34m{Fatah}[0m . 
(16) The new accusations come at a delicate time in U.S. efforts to bring about talks between [33m{Israel}[0m and Palestinian representatives . 
(17) [34m{The State Department}[0m said [34m{it}[0m had received a new letter on the subject from Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens , restating [33m{Israel 's}[0m previous objection to negotiating with any Palestinian tied to [4m[35m{the PLO}[0m . 
(18) Deciding what constitutes `` [1m[36m{terrorism}[0m '' can be a legalistic exercise . 
(19) [3m[31m{The U.S.}[0m defines [1m[36m{it}[0m as `` premediated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents . '' 
(20) To meet the U.S. criteria , [33m{Israel}[0m contended [33m{it}[0m only [1m[32m{listed}[0m incidents that involved civilians and occurred inside [33m{its}[0m pre-1967 borders . 
(21) At the heart of [33m{Israel 's}[0m report is a list of [31m{a dozen incidents Jerusalem attributes to Fatah , including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails}[0m . 
(22) But [1m[33m{U.S. officials}[0m say [1m[33m{they}[0m are n't satisfied [31m{these incidents}[0m constitute terrorism because [31m{they}[0m may be offshoots of the intifadah , the Palestinian rebellion in [4m[34m{the occupied territories}[0m , which [3m[31m{the U.S.}[0m does n't classify as terrorism . 
(23) In addition , [1m[33m{the officials}[0m say [33m{Israel}[0m has n't presented convincing evidence [31m{these acts}[0m were ordered by [1m[34m{Fatah}[0m or by any group [3m[33m{Mr. Arafat}[0m controls . 
(24) [4m[32m{U.S. terrorism experts}[0m also say [4m[32m{they}[0m are highly uncertain about the veracity of [4m[31m{the separate documents leaked to the New York Times}[0m . 
(25) [4m[31m{The papers , which Israel says were discovered in Israeli - occupied Gaza ,}[0m refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called `` the Revolutionary Eagles . '' 
(26) Some supporters of [33m{Israel}[0m say U.S. policy on Palestinian terrorism is colored by an intense desire to maintain [3m[36m{the dialogue with the PLO}[0m . 
(27) But [34m{State Department}[0m officials accuse [33m{Israel}[0m of leaking questionable claims to embarrass [3m[31m{the U.S.}[0m .
