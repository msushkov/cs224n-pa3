(0) We 're going to take `` a closer look '' at [4m[31m{the man who will be inaugurated tomorrow}[0m . 
(1) [4m[31m{He}[0m won the election . 
(2) [4m[31m{He}[0m has a clear and powerful mandate for change . 
(3) [4m[31m{He}[0m will be [1m[33m{the President of Mexico}[0m . 
(4) [4m[31m{Vincente Fox .}[0m 
(5) This is an enormous event for [1m[31m{Mexico which has been ruled for seven decades by the same party}[0m . 
(6) It 's a very important new chapter for Mexican - American relations , because [4m[31m{Mr. Fox}[0m is promising revolutionary change . 
(7) [36m{ABC 's}[0m Sam Donaldson has recently been to [1m[31m{Mexico}[0m to see [4m[31m{him}[0m . 
(8) [4m[31m{The 58 - year - old man who becomes President of Mexico tomorrow , strikingly handsome , wily in the ways of modern politics , enormously appealing as a symbol of change}[0m , has big plans . 
(9) [4m[31m{I}[0m dream about so many things that we can do , eradicating poverty , eradicating crime , violence , corruption . 
(10) [4m[31m{I}[0m believe in people . 
(11) [4m[31m{I}[0m believe in the fact that [32m{people}[0m can change [32m{themselves}[0m . 
(12) [1m[32m{Mexicans}[0m were [4m[33m{voting}[0m for change on election Day , no doubt about [4m[33m{it}[0m , but it is also clear [1m[32m{Mexicans}[0m were [4m[33m{voting}[0m for [4m[31m{a man who has charmed and fascinated them , who has become their political Messiah}[0m . 
(13) [4m[31m{Fox}[0m comes from a farming and ranching family . 
(14) [4m[31m{His}[0m grandfather was an Irishman , but as a young man , [4m[31m{Fox}[0m left the fields to work for [4m[35m{the Coca - Cola company}[0m in Mexico City . 
(15) [4m[31m{I}[0m started as a route salesman working for [4m[35m{the company}[0m . 
(16) Ten years later , [4m[31m{I}[0m was the president of [4m[35m{the company}[0m . 
(17) How do you get to be president of a company in ten years when you start at the age of 22 ? 
(18) Working hard , working hard , man . 
(19) But it will clearly take much more than hard work to make changes that will affect not only [1m[31m{Mexico}[0m but [4m[36m{the United States}[0m . 
(20) [4m[31m{He}[0m says [4m[31m{he}[0m will drive out the drug traffickers . 
(21) [4m[31m{He}[0m promised to reduce poverty , which could mean an open border with [4m[36m{the United States}[0m since fewer Mexicans would want to cross over for jobs . 
(22) [4m[31m{He}[0m 's even promised to stamp out corruption . 
(23) Corruption is the evil of all evils . 
(24) When [4m[31m{you}[0m were [34m{campaigning}[0m , [4m[31m{you}[0m [3m[36m{called}[0m [4m[34m{the opposition , the PRI}[0m , `` blood suckers , '' `` black adders , '' `` leaches . '' 
(25) Do [4m[31m{you}[0m mean [3m[36m{that}[0m ? 
(26) [4m[31m{I}[0m am inviting [4m[34m{them}[0m to govern with [4m[34m{them}[0m together . 
(27) But why should [4m[34m{they}[0m help [4m[31m{you}[0m ? 
(28) [4m[31m{You}[0m beat [4m[34m{them}[0m . 
(29) [4m[31m{You}[0m destroyed [4m[34m{their}[0m power base . 
(30) Well , [4m[31m{I}[0m 'm sure in [4m[34m{their}[0m heart [4m[34m{they}[0m still love [1m[31m{Mexico}[0m . 
(31) Many people here believe [4m[31m{Fox}[0m is naive . 
(32) The danger is probably [4m[31m{he}[0m can not deliver the promises that [4m[31m{he}[0m made during [34m{the campaign}[0m . 
(33) [4m[32m{Javier Trevino}[0m was the campaign manager for the ruling party candidate [4m[31m{Fox}[0m beat . 
(34) If these frustrations occur , what do [4m[32m{you}[0m think [4m[31m{Vincente Fox}[0m will do ? 
(35) Nobody knows , exactly , because nobody knows [4m[31m{Vincente Fox as President}[0m . 
(36) Many of them say to me , `` [4m[31m{Fox}[0m is naive . 
(37) [4m[31m{He}[0m 's not going to be able to do it , and [4m[31m{he}[0m may go off half - cocked . '' 
(38) Well , those who have not been able to do things for 71 years are not the best advice [4m[31m{I}[0m can get . 
(39) [4m[31m{I}[0m know we Mexicans can . 
(40) Optimistic and ha charging , [4m[31m{Fox}[0m takes office [35m{tomorrow}[0m acting like [33m{a man who , indeed , believes he can defy the odds and make his dreams for Mexico come true}[0m . 
(41) [31m{Sam Donaldson}[0m , [36m{ABC News}[0m , on horseback in [1m[31m{Mexico}[0m .
