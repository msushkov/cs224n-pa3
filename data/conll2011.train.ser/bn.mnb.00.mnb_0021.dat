(0) Let 's check in with [31m{the court where it 's the law enforcement watch}[0m . 
(1) [3m[36m{Dan Abrams outside the building .}[0m 
(2) [3m[36m{Dan}[0m , if [3m[36m{you}[0m had to make a case that it could be [4m[32m{tonight}[0m , what are the signs ? 
(3) Well , [3m[36m{I}[0m think the number one most important sign is looking at what happened last night , and that is last night at about 7:00 , the public information officer of [31m{the court}[0m came to [32m{us}[0m and said [4m[31m{we}[0m 're going home . 
(4) [32m{We}[0m are [4m[35m{told}[0m , in effect , there wo n't be a ruling [4m[32m{tonight}[0m . 
(5) [4m[35m{That}[0m has n't happened [4m[32m{tonight}[0m . 
(6) Now , you know the time is ticking away and yet [4m[31m{they}[0m are still here . 
(7) [4m[31m{Everyone}[0m still here . 
(8) All [32m{we}[0m know is that [4m[34m{justices Breyer and Souter}[0m have been [4m[33m{seen}[0m driving away , but [4m[33m{that}[0m does n't necessarily tell [32m{us}[0m anything . 
(9) There are all sorts of possible explanations for [4m[33m{that}[0m . 
(10) It could be that [4m[34m{they}[0m 're not actually involved in finishing up writing one of the opinions . 
(11) Remember , very often , the justices are joint in another justice 's opinion . 
(12) It also could be that [4m[36m{the opinion}[0m is already finished , and , of course , there 's always the possibility that [4m[36m{it}[0m 's not finished , but [3m[36m{I}[0m think the fact that the public information office and many security officers here at [31m{the court}[0m are still here tells [32m{us}[0m that the court is in all likelihood still working on this case . 
(13) [3m[36m{Dan Abrams , outside the , still active court tonight .}[0m 
(14) Thank [3m[36m{you}[0m for that .
