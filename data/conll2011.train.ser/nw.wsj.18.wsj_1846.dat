(0) One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of [4m[34m{the ethnic Turks}[0m out of [3m[33m{Bulgaria}[0m over the past five months has been the lack of international attention . 
(1) The deportation of [4m[34m{more than 315,000 men , women and children}[0m by [1m[32m{the Bulgarian regime}[0m adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years . 
(2) Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry : that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century . 
(3) [4m[34m{Today 's Turks in Bulgaria}[0m , in other words , deserve what is coming to [4m[34m{them}[0m four centuries later . 
(4) As if this were n't enough , [1m[35m{the Senate Judiciary Committee}[0m is getting into the act . 
(5) On Tuesday [1m[35m{it}[0m approved [4m[31m{Senator Bob Dole 's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24 , 1990 , as the `` National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915 - 1923 , '' suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire}[0m . 
(6) There can be no quibbling that [33m{the Armenians}[0m endured terrible suffering , but one has to wonder what possible good [1m[34m{such a resolution}[0m will achieve . 
(7) [1m[34m{It}[0m puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with [4m[36m{Turkey , a country that has been one of America 's strongest allies in NATO}[0m . 
(8) [4m[31m{The resolution}[0m also comes at a time when [4m[36m{Turkey}[0m has been seeking help from [3m[36m{the United States}[0m in resolving [4m[36m{its}[0m Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in [4m[32m{the European Community}[0m . 
(9) [4m[36m{Turkey}[0m has been fighting [4m[36m{its}[0m past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful . 
(10) Must [4m[36m{it}[0m now accept that [3m[36m{one of its strongest allies}[0m blames [4m[36m{it}[0m for [3m[31m{the genocide of another people}[0m ? 
(11) Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward [4m[36m{Turkey}[0m that surfaced when [4m[36m{Turkey}[0m asked for assistance in dealing with [4m[36m{its}[0m Bulgarian emigration crisis . 
(12) [4m[35m{Mr. Dole 's}[0m odd effort notwithstanding , most of [4m[36m{Turkey 's}[0m political problems lie with the Europeans . 
(13) Part of the problem [3m[32m{some Europeans}[0m have with [4m[36m{Turkey}[0m seems to stem from [4m[36m{its}[0m location -- [4m[36m{Turkey}[0m is n't really part of Europe . 
(14) Why , [3m[32m{they}[0m wonder , should [4m[36m{it}[0m belong to [4m[32m{the EC}[0m ? 
(15) Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of [3m[34m{the Turkish people}[0m : [4m[36m{Turkey}[0m , we are told , is not a Christian nation ; [4m[36m{its}[0m people simply wo n't fit in with the Western European Judeo - Christian tradition . 
(16) It 's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that [3m[35m{the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire}[0m comes to the fore . 
(17) No one has to accept the sins of [4m[33m{the Ottoman Empire}[0m to reject [3m[35m{that argument}[0m . 
(18) [4m[36m{Turkey}[0m in any event is long past it . 
(19) [4m[36m{The country}[0m has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations . 
(20) [1m[36m{Kurds}[0m , suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria , Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey . 
(21) Now it is [1m[36m{their}[0m fellow Turks arriving as refugees from [3m[33m{Bulgaria}[0m . 
(22) The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently . 
(23) Surely , the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten . 
(24) But what [1m[35m{the Senate Judiciary Committee}[0m has done in [32m{supporting}[0m [4m[31m{the strongly worded Armenian resolution}[0m achieves no useful end ; [32m{it}[0m merely produces more controversy and embittered memories . 
(25) Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists . 
(26) [3m[33m{Bulgaria 's}[0m government has been [31m{behaving}[0m beyond the pale for months , and [3m[36m{the U.S.}[0m does [3m[36m{its}[0m values no credit by ignoring [31m{that}[0m while casting [3m[36m{its}[0m votes into the past .
