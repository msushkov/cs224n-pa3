(0) Peace as a weapon 
(1) What kinds of challenges face the next leader of [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m ? 
(2) Public opinion surveys show that voters are most concerned about crime and the economy . 
(3) In a February survey conducted by the United Daily News , the number of citizens very concerned about crime was 31 % , eleven percentage points higher than four years ago . 
(4) [1m[33m{Roughly the same percentage}[0m said [1m[33m{they}[0m were most concerned about problems of finance and the economy . 
(5) Early this year Commonwealth magazine asked [35m{citizens}[0m , " What do [35m{you}[0m think is the first thing the new president should do after taking office ? " 
(6) The results show that the people of [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " -LRB- the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians -RRB- , and raising economic competitiveness . 
(7) Senior journalist Chu Sung - chiu says that [34m{all three major candidates}[0m say [34m{they}[0m are opposed to black gold politics . 
(8) But [1m[31m{citizens}[0m want more than slogans , [1m[31m{they}[0m want effective action . 
(9) Political scientist Alexander Lu says that the crux of the issue is resoluteness . 
(10) If the resolve was there , it would not be that difficult to reduce crime and corruption . 
(11) [36m{Ting Chih - jen}[0m says , " Crime is rising fastest among youth . " 
(12) [36m{He}[0m argues that education is in fact the best crime - fighting policy : 
(13) " If students can enjoy a happy learning environment at school , then society will no longer be sitting on a powderkeg . " 
(14) [36m{Ting}[0m says that , although [1m[32m{education}[0m is not a panacea , [1m[32m{it}[0m is certainly not irrelevant . 
(15) Unfortunately , the effects of [1m[36m{education policy}[0m are visible only in the long term , and [1m[36m{it}[0m therefore has a relatively weak position in politics and is often neglected because [1m[35m{policymakers}[0m probably will not see the fruits of [1m[35m{their}[0m efforts in [1m[35m{their}[0m terms of office . 
(16) But the main industries of the 21st century , such as the information and telecommunications industries , are knowledge - based . 
(17) If education is done well , the benefits will spread to many other areas . 
(18) The greatest variable for [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m society remains [33m{the other side of the Taiwan Strait}[0m . 
(19) " In the past two years , [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m has been continually testing where [33m{mainland China}[0m will draw the line in cross-strait relations , " says social critic Nan Fang Shuo . 
(20) But playing word games over how to define the relationship is simply a way of hiding from the problem , ostrich - like , as the situation deteriorates . 
(21) Fortunately [34m{the three main candidates}[0m have committed [34m{themselves}[0m to a moderate path . 
(22) Right now there 's a choice between peace and war in cross-strait relations . 
(23) The most important challenge for [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m now is to transcend the old mentalities of cold war anti-communism and [1m[34m{Taiwan}[0m independence , and to build a new logic of peace . 
(24) [1m[34m{Taiwan 's}[0m future is now in the hands of [1m[34m{its}[0m voters .
