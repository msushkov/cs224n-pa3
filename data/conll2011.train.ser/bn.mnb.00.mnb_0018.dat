(0) Hold that thought , Dafpblet here 's [1m[34m{the Secretary of State in Florida}[0m . 
(1) Good evening . 
(2) On Tuesday evening , [1m[34m{I}[0m requested [4m[32m{those counties contemplating manual vote recounts}[0m to submit a written statement to [1m[34m{me}[0m of the and circumstances justifying any belief on [4m[32m{their}[0m part that [4m[32m{they}[0m should be allowed to [4m[36m{amend}[0m [4m[32m{their}[0m certified returns previously filed by [4m[32m{them}[0m in accordance of law . 
(3) [4m[32m{All three counties -- Palm Beach , Miami - Dade and Broward}[0m , [1m[36m{responded}[0m by the 2:00 p.m. deadline today and [1m[34m{I}[0m thank [4m[32m{them}[0m . 
(4) Copies of [1m[36m{the responses}[0m have already been distributed . 
(5) Additionally , [4m[35m{Colier County}[0m asked about the possibility of an amendment to [4m[35m{their}[0m return , unrelated to the manual recount issue . 
(6) A copy of that letter has also been distributed . 
(7) For the past week , [1m[34m{I}[0m 've devoted a substantial amount of [1m[34m{my}[0m time to issues surrounding the manual vote recount . 
(8) After Judge Lewis ' decision yesterday morning , [1m[34m{my}[0m staff and [1m[34m{I}[0m , along with counsel , developed [32m{criteria appropriate to the exercise of my discretion under Florida law}[0m . 
(9) [32m{This criteria}[0m is clearly set forth in [3m[33m{Florida}[0m case law . 
(10) For the past six hours , [1m[34m{I}[0m 've [31m{applied}[0m [32m{these criteria}[0m in [3m[32m{deliberating}[0m upon the specific requests of [4m[32m{the counties , contemplating manual vote recounts}[0m . 
(11) As a result of [3m[32m{these deliberations}[0m , [1m[34m{I}[0m 've [3m[35m{decided}[0m it is [1m[34m{my}[0m duty under [3m[33m{Florida}[0m law to exercise [1m[34m{my}[0m discretion in denying [4m[36m{these requested amendments}[0m . 
(12) The reasons given in [4m[32m{their}[0m requests are insufficient to warrant waiver of the unambiguous filing deadline imposed by the Florida Legislature . 
(13) [1m[34m{I}[0m have communicated [3m[35m{this decision}[0m with [4m[32m{these counties}[0m in [3m[36m{letters detailing the criteria I used in making my judgments , and the application of these criteria to the stated circumstances}[0m , and copies of [3m[36m{these letters}[0m are also available . 
(14) Because it is [1m[34m{my}[0m determination that no amendments to the official returns , now on file at [4m[31m{the Department of State}[0m , are warranted , [4m[33m{the State Elections Canvasing Commission}[0m , acting in [4m[33m{its}[0m normal and usual manner has certified the results of Tuesday 's election in [3m[33m{Florida}[0m , including [3m[31m{the presidential election}[0m . 
(15) Copies of that portion of [1m[35m{the certification}[0m relating to [3m[31m{the presidential election}[0m and the signature pages of [1m[35m{the certification}[0m are also available . 
(16) As [1m[34m{I}[0m previously indicated , [1m[34m{I}[0m expect that after the receipt , tabulation , and certification of the overseas ballots by [4m[32m{the counties}[0m , [4m[33m{the State Elections Canvasing Commission}[0m will finally certify [3m[31m{the presidential election in Florida}[0m on Saturday . 
(17) The schedule , of course , is subject to judicial intervention . 
(18) In that context , [1m[34m{I}[0m once again will be unable personally to answer questions . 
(19) However , [1m[34m{I}[0m have with [1m[34m{me}[0m [3m[34m{our general counsel , Debbie Kerny and two of our outside counsel , Joe Clock and Deborah Blanton}[0m and asked [3m[34m{them}[0m to remain behind and answer appropriate questions from you . 
(20) One final comment . 
(21) [1m[34m{I}[0m want to reassure the public that [1m[34m{my}[0m decision in this process has been made carefully , consistently , independently , and [1m[34m{I}[0m believe correctly . 
(22) [1m[34m{I}[0m 'm very grateful for your patience and your understanding . 
(23) Thank you , and God bless . 
(24) [4m[34m{Mr. Clock ?}[0m 
(25) Thank [1m[34m{you}[0m .
