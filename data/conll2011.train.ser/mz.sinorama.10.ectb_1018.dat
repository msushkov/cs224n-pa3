(0) Playboys , not chauvinists 
(1) The rapidity with which ideas and fads spread in a wealthy information society means that a love of beauty is not limited to one gender , and body - sculpting does not distinguish between young and old . 
(2) Last year , a survey by [3m[34m{Tung 's Foundation}[0m discovered that [3m[36m{the gender / age cohort most concerned about comparisons between their bodies and others '}[0m is [4m[35m{men aged 60 and above}[0m . 
(3) [4m[35m{They}[0m ranked higher than women or any other age group of men on " willingness to pay money to preserve or enhance physique " and " attention devoted to changes in physique . " 
(4) [3m[34m{The Foundation 's}[0m suggested explanation is that [4m[35m{these men}[0m were focused on [4m[35m{their}[0m careers when [4m[35m{they}[0m were younger , and [4m[35m{they}[0m are only turning [4m[35m{their}[0m attention to [4m[35m{their}[0m appearance as [4m[35m{they}[0m get older . 
(5) The new generation , on the other hand , [3m[35m{strikes}[0m a balance between career and appearance . 
(6) [3m[35m{This}[0m is not necessarily a bad thing . 
(7) In the eyes of feminists , the arrival of the era of male preening has added a number of interesting possibilities to the game of mutual admiration between the sexes . 
(8) But besides lustful appreciation there is a deeper question : 
(9) Do [4m[36m{the " peacocks " who have been influenced in part by feminist consciousness}[0m " have any different ideas or make any adjustments with regard to [4m[36m{their}[0m roles in relations between the sexes ? " 
(10) Not necessarily , it appears . 
(11) He Tu - lin , a staunch advocate of male body autonomy , did an advertisement once for jewelry for men . 
(12) Beneath the soft face was a body of primitive , raw male muscle , with the idea being that jewelry makes a man even sexier . 
(13) The ad copy claimed that jewelry would attract [3m[33m{women}[0m and make [3m[33m{them}[0m " willing to accept your rules . " 
(14) Wang Hao - wei has asked [4m[34m{flashy " pretty boys "}[0m how [4m[34m{they}[0m cope if [4m[34m{their}[0m girlfriends wo n't listen to [4m[34m{them}[0m . 
(15) Often the case is , " I give her a good slap in the face . " 
(16) Despite such anecdotal evidence , however , there are hopes that there will be positives from the new male fashion sense . 
(17) Ning Yin - bin assumes that as men and women compete in corporeal beauty , some balance will be reached , without going to extremes . 
(18) [4m[31m{Lin Ching - yun , who has often expressed in writing her conviction that people should n't go for cosmetic surgery unless they have little choice ,}[0m says that the advantage of men entering the ranks of cosmetic surgery patients is that there is more supervision of the industry ; women who go for plastic surgery accompanied by husbands or boyfriends usually get better results . 
(19) Liu Hsiang , who spends a lot of time dressing and making up , has come to feel deeply the trouble [4m[33m{women}[0m go through in [4m[33m{their}[0m pursuit of beauty . 
(20) Perhaps , when more men can feel the sentiment that women have known for millennia of " dressing up to please others , " gender relations will be a little more harmonious .
