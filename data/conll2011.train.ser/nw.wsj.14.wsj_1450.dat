(0) [1m[34m{The Bakersfield Supermarket}[0m went out of business last May . 
(1) The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs . 
(2) Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan . 
(3) [1m[34m{The business}[0m closed when [3m[32m{the owner}[0m was murdered by robbers . 
(4) The owner was [3m[32m{Israel Ortiz , a 29 - year - old entrepreneur and father of two}[0m . 
(5) In [3m[32m{his}[0m first year of operating [1m[34m{the store he bought for $ 220,000}[0m , [3m[32m{Mr. Ortiz}[0m was robbed at least twice at gunpoint . 
(6) The first time [3m[32m{he}[0m was shot in the hand as [3m[32m{he}[0m chased the robbers outside . 
(7) The second time [3m[32m{he}[0m identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged . 
(8) Two weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- [3m[32m{Mr. Ortiz}[0m was [1m[35m{shot}[0m three times in the back , during what police classified as a third robbery attempt . 
(9) [1m[35m{That}[0m was [3m[32m{his}[0m reward for working until 11 p.m. seven days a week to cover [3m[32m{his}[0m $ 3,000 a month rent . 
(10) For providing what [3m[32m{his}[0m customers described as very personal and helpful service . 
(11) For creating a focus for neighborhood life . 
(12) [3m[32m{Israel Ortiz}[0m is only one of the thousands of [4m[33m{entrepreneurs}[0m and [4m[33m{their}[0m employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year . 
(13) The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2 % of all retail - sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door - to - door salespeople . 
(14) Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers . 
(15) Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem . 
(16) Recent data from [3m[35m{New York City}[0m provide more of the picture . 
(17) While by no means the highest crime community in the country , [3m[35m{New York}[0m is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small - business development . 
(18) [1m[33m{A survey of small businesses there}[0m was conducted this spring by Interface , a policy research organization . 
(19) [1m[33m{It}[0m gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses . 
(20) [1m[33m{The survey}[0m found that over a three - year period 22 % of [36m{the firms}[0m said [4m[36m{employees or owners}[0m had been robbed on [4m[36m{their}[0m way to or from work or while on the job . 
(21) [31m{Seventeen percent}[0m reported [31m{their}[0m customers being robbed . 
(22) Crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that [4m[31m{19 %}[0m said [4m[31m{they}[0m were considering moving . 
(23) [3m[36m{More than one - third of the responding businesses}[0m said [3m[36m{they}[0m suffer from drug dealing and loitering near [3m[36m{their}[0m premises . 
(24) In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year . 
(25) Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average . 
(26) Crime is clearly more deadly to small - scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses . 
(27) Two decades ago , the Small Business Administration reported [4m[35m{Yale Prof. Albert Reiss 's}[0m landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national IRS records . 
(28) [4m[35m{He}[0m found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones . 
(29) [1m[33m{The New York study 's}[0m companies averaged 27 employees ; [36m{their}[0m annual crime losses averaged about $ 15,000 , with an additional $ 8,385 annual cost in security -- enough money to hire at least one more worker . 
(30) The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business . 
(31) Whatever [1m[32m{the monetary crime losses}[0m , [1m[32m{they}[0m may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury . 
(32) After repeated gun robberies , [35m{some entrepreneurs}[0m may give up a business out of fear for [35m{their}[0m lives . 
(33) [32m{One Washington couple}[0m recently sold [32m{their}[0m liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises . 
(34) These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that [4m[32m{National Institute of Justice}[0m Director James K. Stewart calls `` crime causing poverty . '' 
(35) Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents . 
(36) [33m{Small neighborhood businesses}[0m could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining [33m{those businesses}[0m . 
(37) This may help explain why small businesses create 65 % of all jobs nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime - ridden city like [3m[35m{New York}[0m . 
(38) Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime . 
(39) [1m[33m{The New York study}[0m found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 per worker , compared with one - third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees . 
(40) The shift of retailing to [34m{large shopping centers}[0m has created even greater economies of scale for providing low - crime business environments . 
(41) Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to [34m{these quasi-public places}[0m . 
(42) Since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % . 
(43) Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants . 
(44) In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally [1m[36m{relies}[0m on the public police force for protection . 
(45) [1m[36m{This}[0m creates several problems . 
(46) One is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses . 
(47) The number one proposal for reducing crime in [1m[33m{the New York survey}[0m was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two - thirds of the respondents . 
(48) Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves . 
(49) A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses . 
(50) [3m[31m{Only half the New York small businesses surveyed}[0m , for [3m[31m{their}[0m part , are satisfied with the police response [3m[31m{they}[0m receive . 
(51) Some cities , including [3m[35m{New York}[0m , have experimented with [4m[34m{special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses}[0m . 
(52) But [4m[34m{this}[0m raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship . 
(53) Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small - business areas . 
(54) For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits . 
(55) Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density . 
(56) With [4m[32m{National Institute of Justice}[0m support , the Minneapolis police and [1m[31m{the Crime Control Institute}[0m are currently testing the effects of [3m[34m{such a strategy}[0m , comparing [3m[34m{its}[0m deterrence value with traditional random patrols . 
(57) Small - business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small - business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect . 
(58) While no guarantee , [3m[33m{an increased police presence}[0m might even deter further attacks . 
(59) [3m[33m{It}[0m might even have saved the life , and business , of [3m[32m{Israel Ortiz}[0m . 
(60) Mr. Sherman is a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland and president of [1m[31m{the Crime Control Institute}[0m in Washington , D.C .
