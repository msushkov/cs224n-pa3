(0) All together now 
(1) One month before last year 's Chinese New Year , [34m{artist Wang Cheng - liang}[0m placed some articles in the press seeking others like [34m{himself}[0m - single people with nothing special to do on [1m[33m{New Year 's}[0m Eve - to register for [1m[31m{a New Year 's Eve dinner and party at his studio}[0m . 
(2) You did n't have to know anyone else going . 
(3) Plenty of people took up the offer , and [1m[31m{the party}[0m was packed . 
(4) For [34m{Wang}[0m , it was the most fun [34m{he}[0m 'd ever had at [1m[33m{New Year}[0m . 
(5) [1m[36m{Lin Wen - yueh}[0m moved to California once [1m[36m{her}[0m children had grown up and started families of [3m[31m{their}[0m own , so [1m[36m{she}[0m can no longer spend [1m[33m{New Year}[0m with [1m[36m{her}[0m immediate family . 
(6) But [1m[36m{her}[0m enthusiasm for [1m[33m{the festival}[0m has n't waned . 
(7) " Now [1m[36m{I}[0m spend [1m[33m{New Year}[0m with friends who are in similar circumstances to [1m[36m{me}[0m . 
(8) [36m{Each of us}[0m brings a dish for the meal , and makes [36m{his}[0m own contribution . 
(9) It 's all very relaxed . " 
(10) For [1m[36m{Lin}[0m , friendship is as heart - warming as family ties . 
(11) " [1m[33m{New Year}[0m is part of our shared cultural and ethnic memory . 
(12) [1m[33m{It}[0m 's a homeland of the soul for every one of us . 
(13) The external form may have changed , but [33m{the memory of some inner yearning , that sense of needing to belong}[0m , [33m{these}[0m are things that can never change . " 
(14) For [1m[32m{those often - overlooked old folk and street people}[0m , there are special [1m[33m{New Year}[0m dinners organized by private welfare groups , enabling [1m[32m{them}[0m to share in the human warmth of the occasion . 
(15) Last year [1m[34m{the Buddha 's Light International Association}[0m organized [35m{New Year 's Eve}[0m dinners in the north , center and south of [32m{Taiwan}[0m , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . 
(16) This year [1m[34m{they}[0m are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there . 
(17) Another group , [31m{the Creation Social Welfare Foundation - which is well known for its work with street people and for taking care of vegetative - state patients -}[0m runs an annual [35m{New Year 's Eve}[0m party for homeless people . 
(18) " Giving and serving , these too form part of the meaning and purpose of [1m[33m{New Year}[0m . " 
(19) The Venerable Yung Fu of [1m[34m{the Buddha 's Light International Association}[0m hopes that [1m[35m{today 's well - fed , well - clothed people of Taiwan}[0m can extend the warmth and love of [1m[35m{their}[0m own families out to society at large , and especially to those most in need of attention , so as to widen and elevate the meaning of [1m[33m{New Year}[0m . 
(20) It is no surprise that amid the hectic pace of modern life , some of the relaxed good fun has gone out of [1m[33m{Chinese New Year}[0m . 
(21) But as a custom that has been part of the culture for so long , [1m[33m{it}[0m continues to occupy a unique position in our hearts and lives . 
(22) What remains to be seen is how well we can adapt and update [1m[33m{this ancient tradition}[0m to fit the changing needs of modern society .
