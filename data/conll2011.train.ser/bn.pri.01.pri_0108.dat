(0) [4m[36m{The Gulf War}[0m began 10 years ago tonight and ended 6 weeks later with a decisive US victory over [4m[33m{Iraq}[0m , but little has changed since then . 
(1) The two nations are still bitter enemies . 
(2) The United States continues to insist that [33m{UN}[0m sanctions remain against [4m[33m{Iraq}[0m until [4m[33m{Baghdad}[0m completely dismantles [4m[33m{its}[0m programs of weapons of mass destruction . 
(3) The only exception to [32m{the trade embargo}[0m is [4m[31m{the UN Oil for Food Program , which President Saddam Hussein grudgingly accepted 5 years ago}[0m . 
(4) [4m[31m{That program}[0m has helped provide Iraqis with basic foods and stabilize the economy somewhat , but [4m[33m{Iraq}[0m complains that [4m[31m{the program}[0m is inadequate . 
(5) Under [4m[31m{it}[0m [4m[33m{Baghdad}[0m has sold 40 billion dollars worth of oil and has received only 10 billion dollars worth of goods . 
(6) The rest of the money , 30 billion dollars , has gone to pay war reparations , assist the Kurds in northern Iraq and pay for [4m[31m{the UN operation}[0m . 
(7) [4m[35m{Today}[0m [4m[33m{Iraq}[0m 's Oil Minister , Omar Mohammed Rashid called for an end to [4m[31m{the Oil for Food Program}[0m . 
(8) You can not run [4m[34m{a country with 23 million people}[0m with revenues of 16 billion to 20 billion dollars . 
(9) You run [4m[34m{it}[0m from a security council . 
(10) This is totally impossible , even with all the good faith . 
(11) So just imagine with all the bad faith . 
(12) We know there is absolutely no hope for this [4m[31m{program}[0m to succeed . 
(13) There were other signs [4m[35m{today}[0m that [4m[33m{Iraq 's}[0m leaders have few regrets over [4m[32m{the action that precipitated the Gulf War}[0m . 
(14) [4m[33m{Iraq 's}[0m Deputy Prime Minister defended [4m[32m{the 1990 invasion of Kuwait}[0m and claimed that [31m{his}[0m country was the victim of a conspiracy , and [35m{Saddam Hussein 's}[0m eldest son Uday , who is a member of the Parliament , proposed that [34m{Kuwait}[0m should be included in a new map of [4m[33m{Iraq}[0m .
