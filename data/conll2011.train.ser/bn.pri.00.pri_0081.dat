(0) [1m[35m{President Clinton}[0m departs Monday for [3m[31m{Ireland}[0m , [35m{Northern Ireland}[0m and England . 
(1) [36m{The trip}[0m will provide [1m[35m{the President}[0m with a first hand look at how well the Good Friday peace accord [1m[35m{he}[0m helped broker is taking hold in [35m{Northern Ireland}[0m . 
(2) It is a glass is half - full - or - half - empty situation there . 
(3) On the one hand politicians in [35m{Northern Ireland}[0m work co-operatively on a budget and government programs for the first time in 30 years . 
(4) However there is continuing friction over other aspects of [3m[32m{the peace process}[0m . 
(5) [1m[31m{Belfast comedian Patrick Kealty}[0m has [1m[31m{his}[0m take on [1m[35m{Mr. Clinton 's}[0m visit . 
(6) It is the last few months of the presidency so the Middle East has gone belly - up for [1m[35m{him}[0m so like [35m{we}[0m are all [1m[35m{he}[0m 's got left , so [1m[35m{he}[0m is kind of coming back and [1m[35m{he}[0m is clinging and saying , you know , " Please make [3m[32m{it}[0m work , please " . 
(7) So , [1m[31m{I}[0m think [36m{it}[0m was meant to be a lap of honor whether or not [1m[35m{he}[0m salvages [3m[32m{the peace process}[0m because we have actually had too much of [1m[35m{the President}[0m . 
(8) In a way presidents do n't normally pay as much attention to [35m{Northern Ireland}[0m as [1m[35m{Clinton}[0m has , so [1m[35m{he}[0m has actually [1m[34m{paid}[0m the Irish question probably too much attention for a President , and what [1m[34m{that}[0m means is that [1m[33m{the people involved in the peace process here}[0m believe [1m[33m{they}[0m are more important than [1m[33m{they}[0m actually are . 
(9) And when [1m[35m{the President}[0m talks five years ago [1m[32m{we}[0m would have listened and [1m[32m{we}[0m would have been scared , where as now , it is like , " Here we go , Bill - Smill " . 
(10) [1m[31m{Belfast comedian Patrick Kealty}[0m will resurface next week on [1m[36m{our}[0m show when [1m[36m{The World 's}[0m Jennifer Glass reports on [1m[35m{President Clinton 's}[0m trip to [3m[31m{Ireland}[0m and [35m{Northern Ireland}[0m .
