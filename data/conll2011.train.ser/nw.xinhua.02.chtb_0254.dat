(0) [1m[33m{Lockheed and Martin - Marietta , two old - brand military industrial corporations of the US ,}[0m announced [33m{merging}[0m on the 30th , forming [1m[36m{the US 's}[0m largest defense equipment contractor corporation . 
(1) [1m[33m{Lockheed Company and Martin Company}[0m are additional participants in [1m[31m{the growing trend of takeovers and mergers of US companies in the last few months}[0m . 
(2) [1m[31m{This trend}[0m has spread widely to pharmaceutical and medical instrument companies , telecommunication and high - tech companies as well as retail , banks and railway companies , etc . 
(3) According to the statistics of " Time " magazine , from January to July [1m[34m{this year}[0m , the asset value of takeovers announced by US companies was as high as 171.6 billion US dollars increasing by about half over the same period [1m[32m{last year}[0m . 
(4) Within that , in the first 7 months of [1m[34m{this year}[0m , takeovers and mergers in total announced by four big US industries , medical treatment , media , telecommunications and banking , reached 1062 , accounting for one fourth of all takeovers . 
(5) Regardless of whether it is the number of takeover companies or the value of takeover assets , both exceeded or were close to the peak of US company takeovers in the late '80's . 
(6) Observers here hold that since 1994 , reasons for [1m[31m{the US company takeover trend}[0m differ from those of the past . 
(7) Firstly , the general trend of globalization of the world economy compels [1m[35m{companies}[0m to expand scale and combine businesses , increase [1m[35m{their}[0m overall competitive strength and to reduce costs . 
(8) Secondly , [36m{the Clinton government 's}[0m thoughts and actions in constructing the information highway , adjusting the financial industry and reforming the medical insurance system compels related companies to make strategic adjustments . 
(9) Moreover , [36m{the White House 's}[0m attitude towards anti-trust laws is somewhat more relaxed than before . 
(10) Taking the pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies as an example , reforms of hospitals expanding scales of purchasing medicine and medical treatment equipment , and thus reducing unit costs and expanding services , have spread throughout [1m[36m{the country}[0m . 
(11) That the Columbia Medical Company purchased two hospital groups within one month [1m[32m{last year}[0m , thus integrating pharmaceuticals , medical treatment and sales , is one such example . 
(12) For telecommunications companies , the merger of telephone companies with cable TV and wireless communications companies frequently is to mutually complement one another in operations and to dominate the market . 
(13) Recently , the US Congress passed an inter-state banking law , allowing regional banks to operate in other states . 
(14) Handholding among banks is also to reduce overlapping services so as to reduce costs , to strengthen base assets , and expand credit scales . 
(15) For military industry enterprises , [33m{the merger of Lockheed and Martin}[0m and the combination of two old - brand corporations , namely Northrop and Grumman , are both due to the same reason : after the cold war , the [1m[36m{America}[0m 's national defense expenditures gradually reduced , and the scale and strength of military industry enterprises is one of the conditions necessary for winning limited government weapons purchasing contracts . 
(16) Observers here believe that company takeovers has a positive aspect , i.e. , the reduction of cost , the increase in efficiency , and the strengthening of competitive power . 
(17) But , many takeovers are obviously actions that must be taken for companies to survive . 
(18) However , history has proven that " big and complete " monopolies of production and sales is not beneficial to the national economy 's healthy development . 
(19) For instance , in the '70's , mergers of US steel mills directly led to the birth of [34m{a few large - scale unified steel companies}[0m , but [34m{these companies}[0m also faced serious threats from small - scale steel mills , which are flexible in operation and advanced in technology . 
(20) Moreover , company takeovers have had bad effects on consumers in terms of product quality and price , and at the same time on workers ' employment . 
(21) While voice has been given to the opinion that small enterprises are the new forces of economic growth , scaled operation of big corporations will constantly face new difficulties .
