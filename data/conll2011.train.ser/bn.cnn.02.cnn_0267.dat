(0) Bombardment of [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m continues [4m[35m{tonight}[0m and over the past 20 minutes , [1m[34m{explosions}[0m rocking [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m , [33m{central Baghdad}[0m southern Baghdad , [1m[31m{the outskirts of Baghdad}[0m , and importantly , as [34m{the coalition forces , principally U.S. Army forces ,}[0m move against [4m[36m{Saddam Hussein International Airport -- which is about ten miles outside the center of Baghdad --}[0m [1m[34m{those explosions}[0m are intensified . 
(1) If we may again go to the wide screen of what appears to me to be Abu Dhabi television that is providing this picture , 3:20 a.m. in [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m , live pictures again . 
(2) it is very difficult to discern whether or not [3m[32m{that}[0m is , in point of fact , the missiles that we have become accustomed to striking [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m and [4m[34m{its}[0m environs , or whether [3m[32m{it}[0m is the large 2,000 pound JDAM bombs that have been striking targets selected by the coalition in [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m , or whether [3m[32m{these flashes}[0m now represent artillery barrages as fighting continues to take [4m[32m{control of Saddam International Airport}[0m . 
(3) Again , [1m[32m{correspondents , our correspondents embedded with these forces , with them in the field}[0m , saying in some cases [1m[32m{they}[0m can see the lights of the skyline of [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m . 
(4) Over the course of the past two weeks , since this war began , something like 23,000 coalition sorties have been flown , and over the course of the past 24 hours , [32m{1,900 sorties}[0m flown , and we are told that , of [32m{those}[0m , [1m[33m{850}[0m were strike sorties , motor vehicle most of [1m[33m{those}[0m directed against [3m[34m{the Republican Guard}[0m . 
(5) As you know , [3m[34m{the Republican Guard}[0m just outside [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m to defend [4m[34m{the city}[0m and [1m[36m{Saddam Hussein 's}[0m regime , in principal . 
(6) [4m[33m{Two of those divisions}[0m absolutely devastated , destroyed , [4m[33m{the so - called Medina division , and the Baghdad division}[0m . 
(7) [35m{The Baghdad division}[0m , of course , getting [35m{its}[0m name from the fact that [35m{it}[0m is the [3m[34m{Republican Guard}[0m division designated to defend principally [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m . 
(8) Four other divisions we are told have also been hit very , very very hard and are principally trying to reinforce units . 
(9) VA also been hit very hard . 
(10) So we are seeing [3m[33m{a lot of what some of the military officials are calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one person from the center of Baghdad}[0m , and [3m[33m{that}[0m raises questions , questions that have been in front of us since [3m[36m{that first strike on March 19th against the location that the CIA military intelligence thought was a place where Saddam Hussein , perhaps his sons , were}[0m . 
(11) [3m[36m{That preemptive strike they put , I think somewhat elegantly}[0m , trying to strike at the head of the snake . 
(12) New explosions [36m{rocking}[0m parts of [4m[34m{Baghdad}[0m [4m[35m{tonight}[0m . 
(13) We will continue to monitor [36m{that}[0m . 
(14) We , of course , will bring the word to you just as soon as [34m{the Army and coalition forces}[0m do take [4m[32m{control of Saddam Hussein International Airport , just on the outskirts of Baghdad}[0m . 
(15) In southern Iraq today , [31m{British forces}[0m also moving closer to the center of [3m[35m{the second largest city in Iraq , Basra}[0m . 
(16) [31m{They}[0m captured an Iraqi base in an unused factory in the southern suburbs of [3m[35m{that city}[0m . 
(17) Tim Hewart of ITN reports .
