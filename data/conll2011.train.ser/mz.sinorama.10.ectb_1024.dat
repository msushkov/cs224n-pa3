(0) Respect for expertise 
(1) Variously described by [3m[32m{the media}[0m as a crusader for justice , a hard worker and an incorruptible political figure , [3m[31m{Yeh Chu - lan , known as " mother of the country , "}[0m carries considerable seniority within the DPP . 
(2) [3m[31m{Her}[0m aggressive efforts to shore up the Hakka vote for Chen Shui - bian during the presidential election were also crucial to [3m[31m{her}[0m appointment as Minister of Transportation and Communications . 
(3) On the other hand , [3m[32m{the media}[0m also notes that [3m[31m{Yeh}[0m has practically no past connections to [3m[34m{the Ministry of Transportation and Communications}[0m , and [3m[34m{the ministry 's}[0m complex , specialized tasks present [3m[31m{her}[0m with a steep learning curve . 
(4) Addressing these issues , [3m[31m{Yeh}[0m relates , " [3m[34m{The Ministry of Transportation and Communications}[0m , in a word , [3m[35m{is}[0m about ' people , ' making [3m[34m{it}[0m essentially a huge service network . 
(5) With [3m[35m{this}[0m in mind , setting out from the standpoint of ' people ' is the first task [3m[31m{I}[0m have set out for [3m[31m{myself}[0m . " 
(6) In addition , [3m[31m{she}[0m stresses that due to the excessive burdens of the old administration , in which policies were constantly distorted by personal interests and party considerations , perhaps [3m[33m{professionals in the Ministry of Transportation and Communications}[0m were frustrated at being unable to put [3m[33m{their}[0m expertise into play . 
(7) " People want the new government to quell the old never - ending conflicts over individual interests , and draw a line between public administration and politics . 
(8) These are the biggest issues faced by the new cabinet . 
(9) Now is the chance to clear out the cobwebs and get off to a new start . "
