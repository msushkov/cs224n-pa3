(0) [3m[35m{The Justice Department}[0m scrambled to play down the significance of [3m[35m{its}[0m new guidelines concerning prosecutions under [4m[31m{the federal racketeering law}[0m . 
(1) [4m[33m{The guidelines}[0m were distributed to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week . 
(2) [4m[33m{They}[0m discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial . 
(3) But [3m[36m{David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman ,}[0m said [4m[33m{the guidelines}[0m `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . '' 
(4) Use of [4m[31m{the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law}[0m against white - collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized - crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars . 
(5) Critics have complained that [4m[31m{the law}[0m unfairly strips [3m[33m{defendants}[0m of assets before a jury determines [3m[33m{they}[0m have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin [4m[35m{corporate defendants}[0m or force [4m[35m{them}[0m into unfavorable plea bargains . 
(6) In [4m[33m{the new guidelines}[0m , [3m[35m{the Justice Department}[0m says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` [4m[32m{the government}[0m will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from [3m[34m{third parties}[0m assets legitimately transferred to [3m[34m{them}[0m . '' 
(7) [4m[33m{The guidelines}[0m also state , `` [4m[32m{The government 's}[0m policy is not to seek [4m[34m{the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law}[0m where [4m[34m{that forfeiture}[0m would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . '' 
(8) Another provision clarifies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax - fraud charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case . 
(9) [3m[36m{Mr. Runkel}[0m declined to speculate on whether [4m[33m{the guidelines}[0m would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants . 
(10) `` The impact , if there is any , will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use -LCB- racketeering charges -RCB- is made in individual cases '' by [3m[35m{Justice Department}[0m officials in Washington , [3m[36m{he}[0m said . 
(11) In a memorandum describing [4m[33m{the guidelines}[0m , Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis Jr. said that government efforts to freeze defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions `` have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press . '' 
(12) But [3m[36m{Mr. Runkel}[0m said [4m[32m{the government}[0m is n't `` backing off on these kinds of matters at all .
