(0) [4m[31m{Mobil Corp.}[0m is [4m[32m{preparing}[0m to [4m[34m{slash}[0m the size of [4m[31m{its}[0m work force in [3m[35m{the U.S.}[0m , possibly as soon as next month , say individuals familiar with [4m[31m{the company 's}[0m strategy . 
(1) The size of [4m[34m{the cuts}[0m is n't known , but [4m[34m{they}[0m 'll be centered in the exploration and production division , which is responsible for locating oil reserves , drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas . 
(2) Employees have n't yet been notified . 
(3) Sources said that meetings to discuss [4m[34m{the staff reductions}[0m have been [4m[32m{scheduled}[0m for Friday at [4m[31m{Mobil}[0m offices in New Orleans and Denver . 
(4) [4m[34m{This}[0m would be a second round of cuts by [4m[31m{Mobil , which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15 % to 20 % during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide shakeout}[0m . 
(5) [4m[31m{Mobil 's}[0m latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by [4m[33m{other oil companies}[0m in [4m[33m{their}[0m domestic oil - producing operations . 
(6) In [3m[34m{yesterday 's}[0m third - quarter earnings report , [4m[31m{the company}[0m alluded to a $ 40 million provision for [3m[33m{restructuring}[0m costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations . 
(7) [4m[35m{The report}[0m says that `` [3m[33m{the restructuring}[0m will take place over a two - year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in [4m[31m{our}[0m U.S. operations . '' 
(8) A company spokesman , reached at his home last night , would only say that there will be a public announcement of [4m[34m{the reduction program}[0m by the end of the week . 
(9) Most oil companies , including [4m[31m{Mobil}[0m , have been reporting lower third - quarter earnings , largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses . 
(10) Individuals familiar with [4m[31m{Mobil 's}[0m strategy say that [4m[31m{Mobil}[0m is [4m[34m{reducing}[0m [4m[31m{its}[0m U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output . 
(11) [3m[34m{Yesterday}[0m , [4m[31m{Mobil}[0m said domestic exploration and production operations had a $ 16 million loss in the third quarter , while comparable foreign operations earned $ 234 million . 
(12) Industrywide , oil production in [3m[35m{this country}[0m fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year . 
(13) Daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year . 
(14) Some [4m[31m{Mobil}[0m executives were dismayed that a reference to [4m[34m{the cutbacks}[0m was included in [4m[35m{the earnings report}[0m before workers were notified . 
(15) One [4m[31m{Mobil}[0m executive said that the $ 40 million charge related to [4m[34m{the action}[0m indicates `` a substantial '' number of people will be involved . 
(16) Some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations .
