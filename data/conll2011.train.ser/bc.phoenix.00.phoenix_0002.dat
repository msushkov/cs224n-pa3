(0) This has always been the pain in the hearts of many Chinese seismologists . 
(1) Before [4m[35m{the Great Tangshan Earthquake}[0m , [1m[31m{China}[0m had medium - long - range forecasts , [1m[31m{it}[0m had annual forecasts , [1m[31m{it}[0m had imminent forecasts . 
(2) But in the end , the tragic result was that [33m{240,000 people}[0m [4m[31m{lost}[0m [33m{their}[0m lives . 
(3) We should say there is a profound lesson in [4m[31m{this}[0m . 
(4) Why do [34m{you}[0m believe that [31m{the leaders involved}[0m need to take responsibility for [4m[31m{this}[0m ? 
(5) Maybe for [31m{them}[0m it was just an inadvertent mistake , or an oversight . 
(6) [34m{I}[0m believe [31m{they}[0m ought to , , have held a meeting , and maybe reduced the losses . 
(7) Therefore [4m[35m{the Tangshan earthquake}[0m , [34m{I}[0m still say , we are not at the levels , , to forecast on time , on July 28 , 1976 , at approximately 3:42 . 
(8) But we are at the level where we can say , in late July or early August , in that week of time , 
(9) , this all could have been said . 
(10) We 're not at the level to report [4m[34m{that Tangshan City}[0m , the small area of Fengnan in [4m[34m{Tangshan}[0m , but we can report for the Beijing , Tianjin , [4m[34m{Tangshan}[0m and Zhangjiakou area . 
(11) , we have already , very clearly said that . 
(12) We ca n't correctly predict a 7.8 earthquake , but we can forecast an above 5.0 , even above 6.0 , or even that not excluding a 7.0 earthquake , that we can say . 
(13) If you look at the [4m[34m{Tangshan}[0m disaster records , many people might get the impression that [4m[35m{the Great Tangshan earthquake}[0m was not just a natural disaster , but that [4m[35m{it}[0m was made up of many human disasters . 
(14) How do [34m{you}[0m see that ? 
(15) , , , it 's a question [34m{I}[0m ca n't answer clearly here , [34m{I}[0m mean , to be precise , , in addition to a natural disaster it 's also a human disaster . 
(16) That included at the time , , in terms of politics , certainly some campaigns like the Gang of Four , had an effect , , that 's one thing . 
(17) But , [34m{I}[0m mean , [4m[36m{people who are responsible for the earthquake - related decision - making}[0m , [4m[36m{they}[0m did n't do [4m[36m{their}[0m duty and [4m[36m{their}[0m responsibility to [4m[36m{their}[0m utmost . 
(18) The price paid for [4m[35m{the Great Tangshan Earthquake}[0m was [4m[32m{240,000 lives tragically lost}[0m , and [4m[32m{that}[0m will forever be part of history ; 
(19) what lessons should mankind learn from [4m[35m{this great disaster}[0m ? 
(20) Can the tragedy of [4m[35m{the Great Tangshan Earthquake}[0m ever be repeated ? 
(21) What is even more unexpected is that two Chinese seismologists who precisely predicted [4m[35m{the Tangshan quake}[0m and who have spent a lifetime doing earthquake research coincidentally believe that [4m[33m{China}[0m has not made progress in earthquake forecasting levels , but has actually gone backwards . 
(22) If the thing were to , happen in [35m{today 's}[0m China , do [34m{you}[0m think [36m{disaster}[0m could be avoided ? 
(23) Now [36m{it}[0m could not be avoided , now [4m[33m{China}[0m does n't have , uh , this capacity . 
(24) So in terms of [4m[33m{China}[0m , [4m[33m{it}[0m does n't have this capacity . 
(25) In [35m{today 's}[0m China the level of earthquake forecasting , [34m{I}[0m believe , compared to before [4m[35m{the Tangshan earthquake}[0m , has fallen , has slipped by a wide margin . 
(26) If we were once again to continue focusing on earthquake preparedness as before Premier Zhou died , with the policy of the experts and the masses working together , and combining Chinese and foreign methods , then , earthquake forecasting would be on the right track again . 
(27) Now we 're , out of two legs , missing one leg . 
(28) Experts and the masses working together , with the masses monitoring and working on preparedness , it 's all , been [32m{weakened}[0m . 
(29) And [32m{that}[0m 's very disturbing . 
(30) Looking at it in terms of [4m[35m{the Great Tangshan Earthquake}[0m , monitoring and preparedness by the masses and monitoring of ground stress have already been proven ; 
(31) they should be effective , so why are n't they being taken seriously ? 
(32) But that ca n't be , , the Seismology Bureau system , uh , acknowledges , oh ! 
(33) In the , '80s , exactly which year [34m{I}[0m 'm not sure , a conference was held in Quanzhou , we who believe in monitoring and preparedness by the masses call it the three earths , earth electricity , earth stress , and earth magnetism , they denied it all . 
(34) [34m{I}[0m say the method of monitoring and preparedness by the masses used before [4m[35m{the Tangshan quake}[0m , and methods that produced this prediction . 
(35) And also before an earthquake in coastal cities , the method of monitoring and preparedness by the masses , in
