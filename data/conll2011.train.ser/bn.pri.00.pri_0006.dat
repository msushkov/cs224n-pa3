(0) This is [35m{the World}[0m . 
(1) I 'm Lisa Mullins . 
(2) Not since [4m[33m{he}[0m took [31m{power}[0m 13 years ago , has [1m[32m{Yugoslavia 's}[0m President Slobodan Milosevic appeared so close to losing [31m{it}[0m . 
(3) [4m[33m{His}[0m grip began to slip on September 24th , when as [4m[33m{even he}[0m admitted [1m[31m{opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica}[0m won more votes in [1m[34m{a nation - wide election}[0m . 
(4) [4m[33m{Milosevic}[0m claimed , however , that [1m[31m{Kostunica}[0m had failed to win at least 50 % and that another ballot would be necessary . 
(5) The opposition insisted that [1m[31m{Kostunica}[0m had won outright and staged mass anti-Milosevic demonstrations . 
(6) [32m{Today}[0m , [36m{the protest}[0m reached a climax as [3m[31m{hundreds of thousands of people}[0m took to [34m{the streets of Belgrade}[0m . 
(7) [3m[31m{The crowds}[0m took over [1m[35m{the parliament building}[0m and [4m[36m{a state television center}[0m and the events of [32m{the day}[0m resembled nothing so much as a popular revolution . 
(8) [35m{The World 's}[0m Nenad Chebeck takes [35m{us}[0m to [34m{the streets of the Serbian capital}[0m in [3m[32m{his}[0m eyewitness report . 
(9) Rock drummer Dragon Zuricic pounded out a beat for marching and [3m[31m{hundreds of thousands of demonstrators}[0m took up the call . 
(10) Within minutes , the center of [1m[36m{the town}[0m was blocked solid . 
(11) Opponents of [4m[33m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m called on [4m[33m{the Yugoslav President}[0m to relinquish power immediately . 
(12) [4m[34m{An opposition spokesman}[0m demanded that [4m[33m{Milosevic}[0m accept [1m[33m{the electoral will of the people}[0m , that the Federal Electoral Commission reveal what [4m[34m{she}[0m called [1m[33m{the true result of the election}[0m . 
(13) There were speeches and even songs , denouncing [4m[33m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m and praising [1m[31m{opposition leader , Vojislav Kostunica}[0m , but the singing stopped and at least some shooting began . 
(14) [3m[31m{The crowd}[0m converged at [1m[35m{the federal parliament building}[0m and tried to storm [1m[35m{it}[0m . 
(15) The police retaliated with tear gas and most streets around the buildings were full of people and tear gas . 
(16) The mood became angry and several police cars were smashed or set ablaze . 
(17) Then [3m[31m{the demonstrators}[0m turned [3m[31m{their}[0m fury towards a nearby police station . 
(18) That 's when [36m{the mass protest}[0m took what may have been a `` turning point '' . 
(19) [4m[35m{The police}[0m gave [4m[35m{themselves}[0m up without a fight and some of [4m[35m{them}[0m even joined [3m[31m{the demonstrators}[0m . 
(20) Then [3m[31m{the crowd}[0m marched over to [4m[36m{the state run televison station}[0m . 
(21) Much to [3m[31m{the demonstrators '}[0m surprise dozens of heavily armed riot policemen simply walked out of [4m[36m{the building}[0m and offered no resistance . 
(22) Elsewhere in [1m[36m{Belgrade}[0m , [3m[33m{journalists at three other television stations and the radio station B92}[0m took over [3m[33m{their}[0m newsrooms vowing to report independently of state control . 
(23) This evening , police withdrew from [34m{the streets of Belgrade}[0m . 
(24) Outside [1m[35m{the Federal Parliament building}[0m , [33m{hundreds of thousands}[0m gathered for a rally . 
(25) [1m[31m{Vojislav Kostunica}[0m appealed to [33m{them}[0m to stay on the streets and defend democracy . 
(26) [1m[31m{Kostunica}[0m said [4m[33m{Milosevic}[0m took [1m[32m{the country}[0m into several wars and now wanted to wage a battle against [4m[33m{his}[0m own people . 
(27) [33m{The crowd}[0m chanted `` arrest [4m[33m{Slobo}[0m and let [33m{'s}[0m march onto Beveneary 3rd , to [4m[33m{Milosevic 's}[0m residence . 
(28) [1m[31m{Kostunica}[0m advised calm . 
(29) What [1m[31m{he}[0m did n't say was what [1m[31m{he}[0m could n't , which is where exactly [4m[33m{Slobodan Milosevic}[0m is . 
(30) [4m[33m{He}[0m has n't been seen or heard from in the past 24 hours . 
(31) For [35m{The World}[0m , [3m[32m{this}[0m is Nenad Chebeck in [1m[36m{Belgrade}[0m .
