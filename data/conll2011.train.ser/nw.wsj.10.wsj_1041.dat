(0) Federal health officials are expected today to [4m[33m{approve}[0m a program granting long - deferred access to [3m[36m{the drug AZT}[0m for [31m{children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome}[0m . 
(1) Announcement of [4m[33m{the approval}[0m is expected to be made by Louis Sullivan , secretary of Health and Human Services . 
(2) [4m[33m{The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration}[0m comes after two years of restricted access for [31m{the youngest victims of AIDS}[0m to [3m[36m{the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease}[0m . 
(3) [3m[36m{The drug}[0m will be [1m[33m{given}[0m [35m{treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval}[0m . 
(4) [1m[33m{The move}[0m will make [3m[36m{the drug}[0m available free of charge for a time to children with [4m[34m{the disease}[0m and symptoms of advanced infection . 
(5) Adults with [4m[34m{AIDS}[0m have had access to [3m[36m{AZT}[0m since [1m[36m{FDA}[0m approved [3m[36m{the drug 's}[0m usage for adults in March 1987 . 
(6) But despite more than two years of research showing [3m[36m{AZT}[0m can relieve [4m[32m{dementia}[0m and other symptoms in children , [3m[36m{the drug}[0m still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients . 
(7) As a result , many youngsters have been unable to obtain [3m[36m{the drug}[0m and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo n't cover [3m[36m{its}[0m cost of $ 6,400 a year . 
(8) So far , [4m[34m{AIDS}[0m has stricken [3m[33m{1,859 children under age 13}[0m , with many times that number believed to carry [4m[34m{the infection}[0m without symptoms . 
(9) To date , 1,013 of [3m[33m{those children}[0m have died , according to the federal Centers for Disease Control . 
(10) Mothers of young [4m[34m{AIDS}[0m patients expressed somber satisfaction . 
(11) `` Thank goodness [4m[33m{it}[0m 's happening . 
(12) [4m[33m{It}[0m should have happened sooner , '' said [1m[34m{Elizabeth Glaser , a Los Angeles mother and activist who contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion , and transmitted it to two of her children}[0m . 
(13) [4m[31m{One of them , a daughter Ariel ,}[0m died a year ago at age seven after [4m[31m{her}[0m parents unsuccessfully pleaded for [3m[36m{the drug}[0m . 
(14) `` [1m[34m{I}[0m could get [3m[36m{AZT}[0m , '' says [1m[34m{Mrs. Glaser , who bears her infection without any symptoms}[0m . 
(15) `` But [1m[34m{my}[0m daughter could n't , until [4m[31m{she}[0m was too ill to take [3m[36m{it}[0m . 
(16) To watch your child die is an inhuman experience . '' 
(17) [1m[34m{Her}[0m son , healthy and symptom - free , currently takes no medication . 
(18) The delay in getting [3m[36m{AZT}[0m to children has been blamed on a combination of factors . 
(19) Traditionally , the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses , because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape . 
(20) Secondly , critics have charged [3m[36m{AZT 's}[0m maker Burroughs Wellcome Co. with corporate inertia because children account for just 1 % of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market . 
(21) [1m[35m{Wellcome}[0m has replied that [1m[35m{it}[0m is moving ahead to compile the relevant data , and recently promised to develop a pediatric syrup form easier for youngsters to take . 
(22) Still , all this comes nearly a year and a half after [3m[31m{Philip Pizzo of the National Cancer Institute}[0m offered evidence that [3m[36m{AZT}[0m could reverse the ravages of [4m[34m{AIDS}[0m dementia , sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills . 
(23) Since then , roughly 50 pediatric patients have received [3m[36m{the drug}[0m in [3m[31m{his}[0m program . 
(24) To some mothers , the expected [1m[36m{FDA}[0m action is a poignant reminder of what might have been . 
(25) `` [1m[32m{My}[0m first reaction is [1m[32m{I}[0m do n't understand why [4m[33m{it}[0m 's taken so long . 
(26) Why has it taken [3m[34m{people}[0m so long for [3m[34m{people}[0m to understand [33m{pediatric AIDS}[0m is a major problem ? '' asked [1m[32m{Helen Kushnick , whose son Samuel died six years ago at age three , victim of a tainted transfusion}[0m . 
(27) Similar sentiments were voiced on Capitol Hill . 
(28) `` While [4m[36m{I}[0m 'm pleased [1m[36m{the FDA}[0m is finally releasing [3m[36m{AZT}[0m for children , it 's taken much too long to get to this point , '' said [4m[36m{Rep. Ted Weiss}[0m . 
(29) `` Why did it take [1m[35m{Burroughs Wellcome}[0m so long to apply '' for [35m{treatment investigational new drug status}[0m ? [4m[36m{the New York Democrat}[0m asked . 
(30) `` Let 's not forget [1m[35m{this}[0m is the same company that has been profiteering with [3m[36m{this drug}[0m for 2 1/2 years , '' [4m[36m{Mr. Weiss}[0m added . 
(31) [1m[34m{Mrs. Glaser , who is a co-founder of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation , based in Santa Monica , Calif. ,}[0m condemned neither bureaucratic nor corporate foot - dragging . 
(32) `` There 's no finger to be pointed , '' [1m[34m{she}[0m said . 
(33) `` The crucial thing is that [36m{we}[0m learn [36m{our}[0m lesson well , and to make sure other experimental drugs , like Bristol - Myers Co. 's DDI , do n't follow the same frustrating course as [3m[36m{AZT}[0m . '' 
(34) [4m[34m{AIDS}[0m dementia -- which gradually steals children 's ability to speak , walk and think -- is often the most striking aspect of [33m{the pediatric syndrome}[0m . 
(35) For [4m[35m{some patients}[0m , [3m[36m{AZT}[0m has [3m[32m{restored}[0m the ability to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles , giving back a piece of [4m[35m{their}[0m childhood if only temporarily . 
(36) `` It 's impossible to overstate how much [3m[32m{this}[0m means to the families of [4m[35m{these patients}[0m , '' said Samuel Broder , director of [3m[35m{the National Cancer Institute}[0m and a main developer of [3m[36m{AZT}[0m .
