(0) [34m{We}[0m are watching activity in [35m{Baghdad}[0m . 
(1) While [34m{we}[0m do , [34m{we}[0m want to tell you Marines battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of Nasiriyah face stiff resistance from Iraqi paramilitary groups today . 
(2) For some perspective , let [34m{'s}[0m turn to Miles O'Brien with retired Air Force General Don Shepperd . 
(3) Thank you very much . 
(4) If you are going to fight on the ground , you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way . 
(5) A lot of bridges between where [31m{the 3 7 Cavalry and the rest of the U.S. forces}[0m are now and [31m{their}[0m ultimate destination , downtown Baghdad . 
(6) We have [35m{the city laid out for you here}[0m . 
(7) How many bridges in [35m{this city alone}[0m ? 
(8) In this map we have right here , 13 major bridges in [32m{downtown Baghdad}[0m , including the expressway bridge over here . 
(9) Three bridges here attaching East Baghdad to West Baghdad and the palace area . 
(10) This is [36m{one technique , one possible way U.S. forces might seize a bridge , a bridge that might be defended by Iraqis}[0m . 
(11) Let 's look at the animation . 
(12) Typical scenario there . 
(13) It does n't really matter for [36m{this scenario that we 're laying out here}[0m . 
(14) This would be representing M1 - A1 tanks coming towards the [1m[32m{bridge}[0m firing . 
(15) You have to bundle up and line up to go across [1m[32m{that bridge}[0m . 
(16) Makes [1m[32m{it}[0m vulnerable to fire from the other side . 
(17) Potentially chemical weapons , too . 
(18) As we turn the other direction , what you 'll see are [33m{these Iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there}[0m . 
(19) [33m{They}[0m have burns in front of [33m{them}[0m , artillery behind [33m{them}[0m firing back . 
(20) there goes [4m[36m{the smoke screen}[0m . 
(21) The idea of [4m[36m{the smoke screen}[0m is to obscure [4m[34m{the oncoming forces firing at you}[0m from being able to see . 
(22) [4m[36m{It}[0m does n't work , though . 
(23) [4m[36m{It}[0m works both ways . 
(24) [4m[36m{It}[0m obscures you but also obscures [4m[34m{them}[0m . 
(25) Here 's [1m[31m{an f}[0m . 
(26) [1m[31m{He}[0m comes in and wants to identify [1m[31m{his}[0m target and [1m[31m{he}[0m 's got a big -- 
(27) Ca n't see through the smoke . 
(28) [4m[35m{We}[0m 've got some techniques [4m[35m{we}[0m 're going to show you .
