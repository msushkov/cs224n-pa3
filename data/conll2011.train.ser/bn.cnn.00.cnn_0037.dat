(0) Experts [3m[35m{say}[0m there 's no accurate or useful way to profile the personality of a child that might commit violent acts . 
(1) [3m[35m{That}[0m 's according to [3m[31m{a new study from the Secret Service on school violence}[0m . 
(2) [3m[31m{It}[0m shows that attackers , like the two who killed 13 people at Columbine High School last year in Colorado , come from a variety of family and ethnic backgrounds . 
(3) Academic performance ranged from excellent to failure . 
(4) Some -- so far only boys , were considered loners , others popular . 
(5) Behavioral problems were common among some children , but others had no such history . 
(6) Experts say [3m[31m{the study 's}[0m information is still useful . 
(7) [3m[31m{It}[0m 's really a fact - based report , and with [3m[36m{these facts}[0m , [3m[33m{a school}[0m can move out and actually do [4m[31m{prevention}[0m , and some of [4m[31m{that prevention}[0m is to realize that there are [3m[34m{boys out there who are in pain who will just mention it slightly because they are afraid to talk about it}[0m , and [3m[33m{the school}[0m can do something about that . 
(8) [3m[33m{They}[0m can respond in a supportive shame - free way and help [3m[34m{that boy}[0m out before [3m[34m{he}[0m moves on to targeted violence , instead of saying , Boys will be boys or all boys say these things , so let 's just forget about it . 
(9) [3m[31m{The study}[0m also found more than half the students who perpetrated attacks were motivated by revenge and had a history of gun use .
