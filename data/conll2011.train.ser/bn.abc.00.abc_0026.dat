(0) Good evening , [1m[33m{the United States}[0m is bringing [33m{most of its investigators}[0m home from [31m{Yemen}[0m . 
(1) Things have not gone quite as [1m[33m{the U.S.}[0m had hoped . 
(2) [1m[31m{Nearly 200 American agents}[0m went to [31m{Yemen}[0m right after the attack on [1m[32m{the `` Cole}[0m . '' 
(3) [4m[36m{A very high profile investigation in a very tense part of the world .}[0m 
(4) [1m[34m{The Yemenis}[0m are worried about the threat to [1m[34m{their}[0m national sovereignty . 
(5) [4m[35m{We}[0m got [4m[35m{our}[0m closest look at the damage to [1m[32m{the `` Cole ''}[0m today , but even as [4m[35m{we}[0m did , and even as the Secretary of State thanked [1m[34m{the Yemenis}[0m for [1m[34m{their}[0m early cooporation , [1m[36m{investigators in the field}[0m think [1m[36m{they}[0m have hit a brick wall . 
(6) [36m{ABC 's}[0m John Miller reports tonight from [32m{the port city of Aden}[0m . 
(7) [1m[31m{The FBI agents}[0m moved out in a caravan of trucks and buses , with all [1m[31m{their}[0m gear in tow . 
(8) [1m[31m{They}[0m are leaving frustrated . 
(9) [33m{The majority}[0m are going home , some will stay on the Tarawa , a Navy ship offshore . 
(10) Sources tell [36m{ABC News}[0m [1m[31m{the agents}[0m are moving out because of security concerns , but mostly because [31m{the Yemeni government}[0m is not allowing [1m[35m{the FBI}[0m to do what [1m[35m{it}[0m came here to do . 
(11) While there has been a great deal of talk about the high level of cooperation between [3m[31m{the Yemeni investigators}[0m and [3m[31m{their}[0m American counterparts , in [4m[36m{this investigation}[0m , there is a growing level of frustration on the part of U.S. officials , because even now , two weeks into the case , no U.S. agent has been given independent access to interview any of the witnesses or suspects . 
(12) [1m[35m{The FBI}[0m was allowed to visit [34m{suspected safe houses}[0m and collect evidence and fingerprints , but only after Yemeni investigators had been through [34m{the houses}[0m first . 
(13) Yesterday , the American ambassador and a senior [1m[35m{FBI}[0m official met with President Ally Saleh to complain that Yemeni investigators were not sharing leads or information . 
(14) Some U.S. officials believe the Yemeni are concerned about sharing information that could be embarrassing to [31m{a country that has been called a haven for terrorists}[0m , but U.S. officials say without access to the witnesses here , the future of any American prosecution for the murder of 17 sailors is in doubt . 
(15) [35m{John Miller}[0m , [36m{ABC News}[0m , [32m{Aden}[0m .
